Marshchapel Primary has its own nursery 'Little Sheep Marsh', ran by highly qualified teachers. As part of the federation, we also have a specialist learning mentor providing emotional, social and behavioural support. Marshchapel Primary is an all-inclusive school, where every child really does matter. We firmly believe that regular communication between school and home is vital when additional support or guidance is needed for a specific child; we have an experienced special need coordinator and dedicated members of staff, who will go the extra mile to find the correct journey for each child. Whether that be small group intervention, one to one sessions or a specific scheme of work to support their progress. Our teaching assistants provide invention, within the class setting, and are trained in relevant programs that again support special educational needs. Detailed and regular pupil progress meetings hold teachers to account, and when children are not making the progress expected, questions are asked and an action plan is put into place. We also have links to specialist services and outside agencies and will contact them as and when support and advice is needed. The school will then communicate this to parents/guardians. Although we are very careful about adding children to the special need register, we do identify children at an early age, and begin invention to support their needs. Within the nursery setting, we have specialist speech and language assistant through an Elklan t rained practitioner. Marshchapel is a small school and resources can be limited, but by being a part of the Fenland Federation, we have the expertise and resources across the federation that are readily available. At Marshchapel, we pride ourselves that all our children are given the education they deserve.",

The nursery is close to Alford windmill as well as the local primary, secondary and grammar school. Ormsby Lodge is the designated childcare provider for the local Children's Centre and reguarly provides creches for this service.This nursery opened in 2008 and is a stunning Victorian house set within 3 acres of natural gardens with the most amazing play opportunities for children of all ages. Access to the nursery is monitored by the use of a video security door entry system.Although a very impressive building the nursery feels extremely homely. Many of the original features have been retained and the environment offers a great variety of learning opportunities for all children over two floors. The rooms are large and airy with the upper floor being for babies under the age of 2 years. The baby unit has two separate activity rooms, a separate closely monitored sleep room with full size cots to allow the babies to enjoy restful sleep according to their own routines and sleep patterns.A small kitchen area is available to store milk and any weaning foods.A completely separate room on the first floor is provided for Monti's Children's Club and for training courses for parents organised by the local Children's CentreDownstairs the toddler room has space for twelve 2-3 year olds; the room has a library area, a role play area and is well equipped to provide the children with a whole range of interesting and challenging activities and experiences. These small children have an opportunity to rest during the day in cosy, quiet areas and we work closely with parents and carers to sensitively introduce the use of the toilet or potty at each child's individual pace. Our toddlers have access to the outdoors throughout the day.At approximately three years of age the children move into the Pre-School room. We can accommodate up to 36 children in the pre-school. Opportunities for outdoor play and learning are extended; being outdoors offers opportunities for doing things in different ways and on different scales than when indoors. Children can explore, use their senses and be physically active and exuberant. Children can access the resources freely and move them around the room to extend their learning.The gardens at this nursery are fantastic; we place a high emphasis on outdoor play and learning. There is a vegetable garden and we are currently renovating the Orangery into an al fresco style kitchen where children will have the opportunity to select their own home grown vegetables, prepare and then eat them. There is a very large sand and water play area along with a playhouse and den making facilities just to name a few.A qualified cook provides home cooked meals daily, made in our own kitchen. With parental consent all children have the opportunity to be part of the wider community, e.g. village walks, shopping in traditional shops and visiting the windmill, library and church etc. We also are involved in local fundraising efforts.",

The afternoons tend to be more relaxed and spent usually within my own home with an element of educational and developmental activities.I will love and care for your child as I would my own children and provide them with the security and trust they would receive in their own home. I hope this is what you are looking for in a childminder, and my husband and I, and our 2 young sons, look forward to meeting with you and discussing your childcare requirements further.

        "Description": "King Edward VI, in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, opened as an academy in the autumn of 2012. The academy will be a world-class academy, with every member of our learning community feeling part of something very special and having the opportunity to discover and achieve their potential. This is why we have selected \u2018broadening horizons\u2019 as our mission statement. Every student has unique skills. Our personalised curriculum and innovative program of co-curricular activities means we will support the development of well-rounded and confident individuals who will be a credit to themselves and their community. The academy has achieved the Autism Inclusion Mark and Food for Life Silver Award. We have a dynamic Global Dimension agenda and have received the International Schools award from the British Council.We are a bilateral academy \u2013 that is, a secondary school with a grammar stream in each year of entry. We have a strong House system as do all schools in the David Ross Education Trust\u2019s network. Prior to opening, we underwent a wide-ranging refurbishment, with new sports facilities, landscaped gardens and a new learning centre.Students are organised into groups of similar ability, taking into account their 11+ results and recommendations received from primary headteachers. This means our most able students achieve the highest academic standards in the best grammar school tradition. The academy caters for all abilities and offers a full range of curriculum opportunities in modern, purpose-built facilities, enjoying the latest technologies. Our students are known as individuals and their needs are met in full, whether they are academic, vocational, artistic or sporting. The academy also enjoys a sports hall facility, which is shared with our neighbours the Lady Jane Franklin School. We very much welcome parents of incoming students to the academy and would be delighted to give you the opportunity to see what we have to offer your child. The academy was inspected during May 2014 and the inspectors commended the progress that staff and the academy\u2019s sponsor, the David Ross Education Trust, are making on the academic and cultural development of students, and the impact that this is having on raising aspirations and achievement. The inspectors graded the school \u201cGood\u201d across the board, particularly noting that: The proportion attaining five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and mathematics, places the academy in the top 40% of all schools in the country; Teaching across the school is \u201cconsistently good, with some outstanding\u201d practice; Inspectors reported that \"Individual and highly personalised support ensures that disabled students and those who have special educational needs receive the help they need to achieve well.\" and that \"Good support from teaching assistants to improve reading builds students' confidence and self-esteem,and prepares them well for learning later in the academy\". Students express great pride in being a part of the academy. The strong house system adds to their feeling of \u2018being a part of a community\u2019 and sense of \u2018belonging\u2019; The Principal\u2019s good leadership is focusing all staff on raising achievement throughout the academy. This is raising students\u2019 aspirations and ambitions; Students\u2019 spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is strengthened through the exceptional and extensive selection of additional activities offered since becoming a part of the trust; Aspirations have risen through contact with high profile, high achieving sports personalities, politicians and successful business people. To support this, King Edward VI Academy is currently having a sixth form centre built on site, the science labs are being refurbished and new teacher development programmes are being offered through the trust. Wendy Marshall, Chief Executive of the David Ross Education Trust, said: \u201cStaff and students at the school should be rightly proud of the progress that they have made. \u201cThe one thing that I am particularly delighted about is that Ofsted inspectors\u2019 recognised the impact that all the hard work and dedication is having on the young people themselves. \u201cNot only are results improving, but more students are going on to bigger and better things. Ensuring that we can enable students to fulfil their own potential and aspirations are at the heart of everything the Trust stands for.\u201d",

Marshchapel Primary has its own nursery 'Little Sheep Marsh', ran by highly qualified teachers. As part of the federation, we also have a specialist learning mentor providing emotional, social and behavioural support. Marshchapel Primary is an all-inclusive school, where every child really does matter. We firmly believe that regular communication between school and home is vital when additional support or guidance is needed for a specific child; we have an experienced special need coordinator and dedicated members of staff, who will go the extra mile to find the correct journey for each child. Whether that be small group intervention, one to one sessions or a specific scheme of work to support their progress. Our teaching assistants provide invention, within the class setting, and are trained in relevant programs that again support special educational needs. Detailed and regular pupil progress meetings hold teachers to account, and when children are not making the progress expected, questions are asked and an action plan is put into place. We also have links to specialist services and outside agencies and will contact them as and when support and advice is needed. The school will then communicate this to parents/guardians. Although we are very careful about adding children to the special need register, we do identify children at an early age, and begin invention to support their needs. Within the nursery setting, we have specialist speech and language assistant through an Elklan t rained practitioner. Marshchapel is a small school and resources can be limited, but by being a part of the Fenland Federation, we have the expertise and resources across the federation that are readily available. At Marshchapel, we pride ourselves that all our children are given the education they deserve.",

Ormsby Lodge is the designated childcare provider for the local Children's Centre and reguarly provides creches for this service.This nursery opened in 2008 and is a stunning Victorian house set within 3 acres of natural gardens with the most amazing play opportunities for children of all ages. Access to the nursery is monitored by the use of a video security door entry system.Although a very impressive building the nursery feels extremely homely. Many of the original features have been retained and the environment offers a great variety of learning opportunities for all children over two floors. The rooms are large and airy with the upper floor being for babies under the age of 2 years. The baby unit has two separate activity rooms, a separate closely monitored sleep room with full size cots to allow the babies to enjoy restful sleep according to their own routines and sleep patterns.A small kitchen area is available to store milk and any weaning foods.A completely separate room on the first floor is provided for Monti's Children's Club and for training courses for parents organised by the local Children's CentreDownstairs the toddler room has space for twelve 2-3 year olds; the room has a library area, a role play area and is well equipped to provide the children with a whole range of interesting and challenging activities and experiences. These small children have an opportunity to rest during the day in cosy, quiet areas and we work closely with parents and carers to sensitively introduce the use of the toilet or potty at each child's individual pace. Our toddlers have access to the outdoors throughout the day.At approximately three years of age the children move into the Pre-School room. We can accommodate up to 36 children in the pre-school. Opportunities for outdoor play and learning are extended; being outdoors offers opportunities for doing things in different ways and on different scales than when indoors. Children can explore, use their senses and be physically active and exuberant. Children can access the resources freely and move them around the room to extend their learning.The gardens at this nursery are fantastic; we place a high emphasis on outdoor play and learning. There is a vegetable garden and we are currently renovating the Orangery into an al fresco style kitchen where children will have the opportunity to select their own home grown vegetables, prepare and then eat them. There is a very large sand and water play area along with a playhouse and den making facilities just to name a few.A qualified cook provides home cooked meals daily, made in our own kitchen. With parental consent all children have the opportunity to be part of the wider community, e.g. village walks, shopping in traditional shops and visiting the windmill, library and church etc. We also are involved in local fundraising efforts.",

We provide the highest quality play education in a warm and caring environment within which all children can learn and develop as they play. Our gardens include a forest school, sensory areas, willow domes, pavilions and a friendship garden was added in 2018. We are keen on outdoor learning and go outdoors in all weathers.  RAFA Kidzone places a great emphasis on working in partnership with parents. Our highly trained staff are all qualified first aiders and continuous professional development is encouraged for all staff to keep up to date with new initiatives within the early years sector. The children are provided with nutritious meals freshly prepared on the premises by the kitchen team. They cater for dietary needs and work closely with parents to ensure that children are safely catered for.  Children progress through four rooms within the nursery according to age and the capacity of each room. Throughout their time with at nursery the children will follow the Early Years Foundation Stage, a curriculum to ensure children reach their full potential across all areas of development. We use Tapestry, an online learning journal to monitor and record each child's development.",

The mornings a child spends in my care will tend to be quite active and will involve being out and about visiting places of interest, play areas or groups, or other childminding colleagues and socialising with their children. The afternoons tend to be more relaxed and spent usually within my own home with an element of educational and developmental activities.I will love and care for your child as I would my own children and provide them with the security and trust they would receive in their own home. I hope this is what you are looking for in a childminder, and my husband and I, and our 2 young sons, look forward to meeting with you and discussing your childcare requirements further.

        "Description": "King Edward VI, in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, opened as an academy in the autumn of 2012. The academy will be a world-class academy, with every member of our learning community feeling part of something very special and having the opportunity to discover and achieve their potential. This is why we have selected \u2018broadening horizons\u2019 as our mission statement. Every student has unique skills. Our personalised curriculum and innovative program of co-curricular activities means we will support the development of well-rounded and confident individuals who will be a credit to themselves and their community. The academy has achieved the Autism Inclusion Mark and Food for Life Silver Award. We have a dynamic Global Dimension agenda and have received the International Schools award from the British Council.We are a bilateral academy \u2013 that is, a secondary school with a grammar stream in each year of entry. We have a strong House system as do all schools in the David Ross Education Trust\u2019s network. Prior to opening, we underwent a wide-ranging refurbishment, with new sports facilities, landscaped gardens and a new learning centre.Students are organised into groups of similar ability, taking into account their 11+ results and recommendations received from primary headteachers. This means our most able students achieve the highest academic standards in the best grammar school tradition. The academy caters for all abilities and offers a full range of curriculum opportunities in modern, purpose-built facilities, enjoying the latest technologies. Our students are known as individuals and their needs are met in full, whether they are academic, vocational, artistic or sporting. The academy also enjoys a sports hall facility, which is shared with our neighbours the Lady Jane Franklin School. We very much welcome parents of incoming students to the academy and would be delighted to give you the opportunity to see what we have to offer your child. The academy was inspected during May 2014 and the inspectors commended the progress that staff and the academy\u2019s sponsor, the David Ross Education Trust, are making on the academic and cultural development of students, and the impact that this is having on raising aspirations and achievement. The inspectors graded the school \u201cGood\u201d across the board, particularly noting that: The proportion attaining five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and mathematics, places the academy in the top 40% of all schools in the country; Teaching across the school is \u201cconsistently good, with some outstanding\u201d practice; Inspectors reported that \"Individual and highly personalised support ensures that disabled students and those who have special educational needs receive the help they need to achieve well.\" and that \"Good support from teaching assistants to improve reading builds students' confidence and self-esteem,and prepares them well for learning later in the academy\". Students express great pride in being a part of the academy. The strong house system adds to their feeling of \u2018being a part of a community\u2019 and sense of \u2018belonging\u2019; The Principal\u2019s good leadership is focusing all staff on raising achievement throughout the academy. This is raising students\u2019 aspirations and ambitions; Students\u2019 spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is strengthened through the exceptional and extensive selection of additional activities offered since becoming a part of the trust; Aspirations have risen through contact with high profile, high achieving sports personalities, politicians and successful business people. To support this, King Edward VI Academy is currently having a sixth form centre built on site, the science labs are being refurbished and new teacher development programmes are being offered through the trust. Wendy Marshall, Chief Executive of the David Ross Education Trust, said: \u201cStaff and students at the school should be rightly proud of the progress that they have made. \u201cThe one thing that I am particularly delighted about is that Ofsted inspectors\u2019 recognised the impact that all the hard work and dedication is having on the young people themselves. \u201cNot only are results improving, but more students are going on to bigger and better things. Ensuring that we can enable students to fulfil their own potential and aspirations are at the heart of everything the Trust stands for.\u201d",

Marshchapel Primary has its own nursery 'Little Sheep Marsh', ran by highly qualified teachers. As part of the federation, we also have a specialist learning mentor providing emotional, social and behavioural support. Marshchapel Primary is an all-inclusive school, where every child really does matter. We firmly believe that regular communication between school and home is vital when additional support or guidance is needed for a specific child; we have an experienced special need coordinator and dedicated members of staff, who will go the extra mile to find the correct journey for each child. Whether that be small group intervention, one to one sessions or a specific scheme of work to support their progress. Our teaching assistants provide invention, within the class setting, and are trained in relevant programs that again support special educational needs. Detailed and regular pupil progress meetings hold teachers to account, and when children are not making the progress expected, questions are asked and an action plan is put into place. We also have links to specialist services and outside agencies and will contact them as and when support and advice is needed. The school will then communicate this to parents/guardians. Although we are very careful about adding children to the special need register, we do identify children at an early age, and begin invention to support their needs. Within the nursery setting, we have specialist speech and language assistant through an Elklan t rained practitioner. Marshchapel is a small school and resources can be limited, but by being a part of the Fenland Federation, we have the expertise and resources across the federation that are readily available. At Marshchapel, we pride ourselves that all our children are given the education they deserve.",

The nursery is close to Alford windmill as well as the local primary, secondary and grammar school. Ormsby Lodge is the designated childcare provider for the local Children's Centre and reguarly provides creches for this service.This nursery opened in 2008 and is a stunning Victorian house set within 3 acres of natural gardens with the most amazing play opportunities for children of all ages. Access to the nursery is monitored by the use of a video security door entry system.Although a very impressive building the nursery feels extremely homely. Many of the original features have been retained and the environment offers a great variety of learning opportunities for all children over two floors. The rooms are large and airy with the upper floor being for babies under the age of 2 years. The baby unit has two separate activity rooms, a separate closely monitored sleep room with full size cots to allow the babies to enjoy restful sleep according to their own routines and sleep patterns.A small kitchen area is available to store milk and any weaning foods.A completely separate room on the first floor is provided for Monti's Children's Club and for training courses for parents organised by the local Children's CentreDownstairs the toddler room has space for twelve 2-3 year olds; the room has a library area, a role play area and is well equipped to provide the children with a whole range of interesting and challenging activities and experiences. These small children have an opportunity to rest during the day in cosy, quiet areas and we work closely with parents and carers to sensitively introduce the use of the toilet or potty at each child's individual pace. Our toddlers have access to the outdoors throughout the day.At approximately three years of age the children move into the Pre-School room. We can accommodate up to 36 children in the pre-school. Opportunities for outdoor play and learning are extended; being outdoors offers opportunities for doing things in different ways and on different scales than when indoors. Children can explore, use their senses and be physically active and exuberant. Children can access the resources freely and move them around the room to extend their learning.The gardens at this nursery are fantastic; we place a high emphasis on outdoor play and learning. There is a vegetable garden and we are currently renovating the Orangery into an al fresco style kitchen where children will have the opportunity to select their own home grown vegetables, prepare and then eat them. There is a very large sand and water play area along with a playhouse and den making facilities just to name a few.A qualified cook provides home cooked meals daily, made in our own kitchen. With parental consent all children have the opportunity to be part of the wider community, e.g. village walks, shopping in traditional shops and visiting the windmill, library and church etc. We also are involved in local fundraising efforts.",

There may be an extra \u00a310.00 charge per 15 minutes if children are not collected by 5.30 pm. Persistent lateness will result in the place being withdrawn.

It was felt there was a need for support and that the best kind of support would come from parents who had shared a similar experience. PASIC has now grown and is currently supporting over 400 families throughout the East Midlands who have been diagnosed or receiving treatment at Nottingham's Childrens Hospital. A large part of that support comes through our social events - organised to bring families together in a relaxed atmosphere where they can catch up with friends that they have made whilst in hospital and make new friends with families whose children have already completed their treatment. PASIC provides help and support to families in the following ways; PASIC Grants PASIC offers financial support in the form of a grant, given to help families with additional costs which come about as a direct result of the child's illness. Help is given to pay bills such as additional heating, increased phone bills, laundry or travel expenses. Considerations is also given to requests for specific items that are deemed necessary due to restrictions caused by a child's illness Social Activities PASIC organise a variety of social occasions, activities and outings for the whole family. Bringing families together in a relaxed environment helps to relieve stress and build important support networks with other families in a similar situation. Organised activities can be key to bringing families together during what can be an extremely difficult period; when siblings of a seriously ill child are often lacking attention. Communication PASIC produces a quarterly newsletter, which helps parents keep in touch with each other and provides focus on the ways that PASIC is able to help, either through the activities on offer or by sharing other parents messages. Support for teenagers PASIC is currently exploring ways of supporting teenage patients with activities specifically aimed at this age group. PASIC relies on the support of its partners in the hospital, the medical staff, the nursing staff and the social work team, to name but a few, if you think you can help we would love to hear from you.",

        "Description": "My approach to childminding is one that I hope shows the specialism and professionalism that a nursery provides but with a more personal and loving approach a child can only receive in a home from home environment. The mornings a child spends in my care will tend to be quite active and will involve being out and about visiting places of interest, play areas or groups, or other childminding colleagues and socialising with their children. The afternoons tend to be more relaxed and spent usually within my own home with an element of educational and developmental activities.I will love and care for your child as I would my own children and provide them with the security and trust they would receive in their own home. I hope this is what you are looking for in a childminder, and my husband and I, and our 2 young sons, look forward to meeting with you and discussing your childcare requirements further. And maybe even to eventually look after your precious little one(s)...",

It was felt there was a need for support and that the best kind of support would come from parents who had shared a similar experience. PASIC has now grown and is currently supporting over 400 families throughout the East Midlands who have been diagnosed or receiving treatment at Nottingham's Childrens Hospital. A large part of that support comes through our social events - organised to bring families together in a relaxed atmosphere where they can catch up with friends that they have made whilst in hospital and make new friends with families whose children have already completed their treatment. PASIC provides help and support to families in the following ways; PASIC Grants PASIC offers financial support in the form of a grant, given to help families with additional costs which come about as a direct result of the child's illness. Help is given to pay bills such as additional heating, increased phone bills, laundry or travel expenses. Considerations is also given to requests for specific items that are deemed necessary due to restrictions caused by a child's illness Social Activities PASIC organise a variety of social occasions, activities and outings for the whole family. Bringing families together in a relaxed environment helps to relieve stress and build important support networks with other families in a similar situation. Organised activities can be key to bringing families together during what can be an extremely difficult period; when siblings of a seriously ill child are often lacking attention. Communication PASIC produces a quarterly newsletter, which helps parents keep in touch with each other and provides focus on the ways that PASIC is able to help, either through the activities on offer or by sharing other parents messages. Support for teenagers PASIC is currently exploring ways of supporting teenage patients with activities specifically aimed at this age group. PASIC relies on the support of its partners in the hospital, the medical staff, the nursing staff and the social work team, to name but a few, if you think you can help we would love to hear from you.",

Boston rugby club also field a 2nd/Development team who play in the Lincolnshire Merit League as well as running a thriving juniors/minis section who recently won Club of the year at the Boston standard sports awards. Boston Rugby Club was founded in 1927 by Ernst Clark, a gentleman with an interest in giving his boys and their friends something to do, or rather something to keep them out of trouble. The first 'home' pitch was off Rosebery Avenue in Mountains Field, an unused plot of farmland and the players turned out in blue and white hooped shirts, as they still do. After match entertainment was at the White Hart Hotel. The hotel provided changing facilities which were an old shed out the back which included a tin tank bath. However, this did not unhinge the players as they served a fine pint of Worthington 'E'! It was like drinking dynamite - a drop so powerful that Boston people could only drink it in 1/2 pints. Visitors however drunk pints and were worse for wear very quickly. Whitbread Tankard was sold at BRFC Clubhouse In 1998 Boston Rugby Club proposed a project that would improve the development of sports within the community. The idea was to build a new facility that would house not only rugby and athletics but would also be fully accessible to people with a disability. Boston Rugby Club produced initial proposals for the enhanced facilities and these proposals were endorsed by the Borough Council in April 1998. Working in partnership with the local authority; the Rugby Club and Boston & District Athletic Club formed the 'Disabled and Able-bodied British Sports Initiative' which operated under the name of dabsi. Work soon commenced on the first phase of the project with the help of major sponsor Finnforest, a global timber manufacturer whose UK base is in Boston. The second phase of the project saw the development of the Rugby Club area and the whole development received Royal Assent when it was officially opened by the Princess Royal and is now known as the Princess Royal Sports Arena. With the new stadium the club can now offer their members the magnificent playing, training and competition facilities. The club also aims to host county and representative matches at both senior and youth level. The new bar and function area is the centre of the club and complete with a fully equipped kitchen, the clubhouse is the focus of the social side of the club. With the latest addition of two 42\" plasma televisions all international games can be viewed in style. The bar hosts everything from informal drinking to annual presentations and the club is also available for hire for birthdays, weddings and other events",
