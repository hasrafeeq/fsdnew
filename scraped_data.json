        "Name": "Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) Scheme",
        "Description": "What is the CHIP scheme? The CHIP scheme aims to help Lincolnshire families keep their children safe from home accidents. Accidents in and around the home are a leading cause of preventable death and disability for children under 5 years old. How does the CHIP scheme work? Home safety interventions that include a combination of home safety assessment, parent education and provision and fitting of safety equipment can be effective in preventing child accidents in the home.  The CHIP scheme provides a range of resources to staff and volunteers working with families so they can support families with accident prevention. There's also an equipment fitting service that families can be referred to if they need safety equipment. CHIP Assessment The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that homes with children under 5 have a 'structured home safety assessment' to identify and address any child injury risks in the home. The purpose of the CHIP assessment is help practitioners:  take a systematic approach to identifying child injury risk in the home give consistent safety advice according to the latest evidence, and keep a record of identified risks and the action taken to mitigate them.  The assessment looks at risks associated with developmental milestones as there's a strong link between the types of accidents children are involved in and their stage of development. It also takes a Sign of Safety approach, encouraging families to think about what's working well and what actions can be taken to make their children safer. The CHIP assessment can be downloaded at the bottom of the page. It comes with a guide containing all the safety messages relating to each question on the assessment.  You can complete the assessment online and on submission a copy will be sent to your email address. It's also available on Mosaic so it can be added to a child/family's record. CHIP Training Parent education plays an important role in preventing child accidents in the home. Staff and volunteers working with families are in a great position to educate parents and carers about child injuries and how they can be prevented.   The CHIP e-learning module is a must-do for anyone who works with children under 5 years of age or supports families with children under 5. It takes around 20 minutes and by the end practitioners will be able to:  Identify what causes the most common and serious injuries in the under 5s and what can be done to prevent them Explain the link between child development and injuries Find useful resources to help you prevent accidents.  Here's how to access the course:  Go to: https://safeguardinglincolnshire.vc-enable.co.uk.  Instructions of how to register are attached. Click 'Learning' Click 'Available learning' Type 'Chip' into search bar. 'Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) E-Learning' will appear Click 'Start' and then click 'Start' again Click 'Download' and then open the PowerPoint Click 'Slide Show' once in the document and click through it using the mouse or spacebar Once finished, click 'Next' in the e-learning site and it'll take you to a quiz. Complete the quiz to gain a certificate.  CHIP Visits Click here to refer. Please read the information below before referring.  Be aware that the fire service is operating a reduced home visiting service at the moment, and only high risk cases will be considered for a CHIP visit. You can submit your referral and the fire service will make arrangements to visit once services return to normal. If you feel that the case is high risk – i.e. there's an imminent and high risk of child injury and the installation of equipment can reduce that risk – then please email chips@lincolnshire.gov.uk with your referral with further information. CHIP Visits are provided by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue (LFR). Upon referral, LFR will visit the household and supply/fit safety equipment as necessary. This may include:  Safety gates (to prevent access to and falls on stairs) Window restrictors (to prevent falls from windows) Fire guards (to prevent access to open fires) Cupboard locks (to prevent access to cupboards containing medicines and poisonous household chemicals) Blind cord cleats (to prevent access to blind cords which could cause entanglement and suffocation) Hair-straightener pouches (to prevent burns from hot hair straighteners)  They will also undertake a home fire safety check which includes escape planning with the family and installation of smoke or CO alarms, if needed. Referrals for CHIP Visits can only be made by Early Help Workers, Early Years Practitioners, Health Visitors, Family Health Workers and Social Workers. The referral form will ask for a copy of the household's CHIP Assessment. This demonstrates the need for equipment and evidences that home safety has been discussed with the family. It’s important to note that LFR's responsibility is to assess for and fit safety equipment according to manufacturer's instructions and best practice. It is not LFR's responsibility to educate parents about accident prevention – this is the responsibility of the referring practitioner. Evidence shows that the provision and installation of safety equipment is only successful in preventing injuries when combined with parent education. The CHIP e-learning and assessment tool are designed to support practitioners with this. CHIP Visits are targeted at households where children are at greatest risk of injury. The following characteristics indicate that a child may be at high risk:  They live in areas of deprivation They live in rented accommodation, poor quality housing or homes of multiple occupancy Their parents are unemployed or have never worked Their parent’s ability to supervise is impaired (i.e. due to mental health problems, health/care needs, substance misuse, number of children in property) They have young or single parents with poor support networks Their parents can’t afford safety equipment.  The following eligibility criteria is therefore applied. The child/family must be on:  Child protection plan Child in Need assessment/plan Early Support Care Co-ordination (ESCO) Team Around the Child (TAC) plan Income Based Jobseekers Allowance; Income Related Employment Support Allowance; Income Support. Also including Universal Credit Working Tax Credits or Child Tax Credits Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit  Some points to consider before referring:  Ensure you have consent of the parent/carer If the parent/carer is a tenant they will need to have permission from their landlord Be aware that LFR will not install safety gates unless there is a child aged less than 24 months in the property You will be notified with details of action taken during the visit. Please retain this in the child/family record.  Useful resources Child Milestone Cards. Lincolnshire County Council has produced 6 child milestone cards for families to remember and celebrate their child's first developmental milestones (see Downloads). On the back of each card is advice on how to keep children safe from accidents as they grow and learn new skills. They can be used for displays and campaigns or as teaching resources in one-to-one or group sessions on child safety. When professionally printed they make a great gift for families.   Public Health England's Preventing Unintentional Injuries Guide is for all staff working with children under 5 years and covers data, actions for practitioners and safety messages for parents and carers. The Keeping Children Safe at Home research programme, led by University of Nottingham, has produced an Injury Prevention Briefing with ideas for activities, education and training for practitioners working with children and families. The Lullaby Trust has excellent, easy-read safe sleep resources. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Parent Hub has advice for parents on keeping their under 5s safe. The Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT) is the UK’s leading charity working to reduce the number of children and young people killed, disabled or seriously injured in accidents. Below in the downloads is a safety messages card game and answer sheet. This is a good game to play with parents and teaches about potential risks and how to reduce or eliminate them. Print off the sheet, cut into cards, shuffle and get people to match the hazard with the correct safety advice. Further information Please contact chips@lincolnshire.gov.uk.",

We aim to give our students the tools they need to enjoy learning. Our programmes establish strong foundations in maths and English, helping your child to feel confident enough to tackle challenging work. Rather than offering conventional maths and English tuition, our Instructors set themselves apart by guiding their students through work that is set at just the right level for them, keeping them engaged and making progress. They support and encourage students to work out answers by themselves, helping them to become self-sufficient, successful learners for the future. By studying little and often through daily worksheets and twice weekly study centre visits, our students steadily increase ability and fluency, building their skills in small, manageable steps.",

The assessments, resources and support are designed by speech and language therapists and specialist teachers.   We know that the best indicator of how a child will cope with school is their understanding and use of spoken language. The standardised assessment identifies pupils with difficulties understanding core language skills. Over 160,000 children were screened in 2017/18 using our packages. Identified pupils receive a targeted programme of interventions. The classroom strategies, small group interventions and 1-1 supplementary teaching sessions make the best use of a TA's time and expertise.   Teacher engagement ratings and parent and pupil views support evidence of improvement, essential for Ofsted and the Pupil Premium.

        "Description": "Did you know that sign language has been proven to be an effective form of communication for babies? If you consider the frustrations felt by babies then you'll understand the benefits signing can provide for both the parent and child.  Many children naturally use gestures and pointing but signing allows them to be specific about their needs. It takes the guesswork out and dramatically reduces frustration resulting in less stress for everybody concerned!  They can begin learning right from birth but won't have the dexterity to begin to sign until around four to six months. First signs are usually things that are most important to them such as 'milk'. This can then develop onto more complex signing as they grow such as signing 'teeth', 'hurt' and 'medicine' for when they have teething pain. The key to success is to reinforce the signs whenever possible and ensure the sign is used alongside the spoken word. The signs are not used on their own because the point of signing with babies is not to replace the spoken language but to enhance it. Many question the potential impact signing could have on the development of speech. You may be surprised to learn that signing not only encourages early speech but can also result in a wider vocabulary. Some wonder if the classes will be taught in the style of a typical lesson as essentially, they are gaining an education and skill. Sessions have been designed to be delivered in the most age appropriate way so songs, puppets, musical instruments and bubbles are used to enrich the learning process and create an atmosphere of fun. Children of all ages love doing actions along to songs but Baby Signing takes it a step further and teaches them something that will be of great use to them now and in the future.",

Due to our small size and rural location we are able to provide unique learning opportunities for all of our children based on their individual learning and development requirements.    Our Preschool   Busy Bees Early Years and Nature Centre was established over 30 years ago from a need in the village for local childcare. Three ladies from the local RAF Station came together and developed a toddler group in the old pavilion. There have been lots of changes to Early Years Education since the early days of the preschool. Standards are now inspected and the children assessed against the aims of the governments curriculum called the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum. We offer ‘good’ standards of care and education as judged by OFSTED.     Our Hours   We are open Monday to Thursday during term time however activity clubs and family sessions will be available during school holidays.

        "Description": "Early support for families ensures children receive the very best start in life. We believe that actively involving parents in their child’s early learning contributes positively towards their long‑term development. Our approach From the very beginning, we recognised the value of learning through play and the important role of parents in this process. The benefits have been acknowledged by Government and addressed in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. We continue to lead the sector in this area by delivering services which use play to promote learning and development. Baby and Toddler groups Baby and toddler groups, or stay and play sessions, are extremely popular with young families. We offer practical advice and support to over 2500 groups and deliver quality baby and toddler sessions to thousands of families every year. The benefits of these groups are enormous. Parents, babies and toddlers can:  enjoy positive and playful time together in an informal, friendly space. use a variety of resources and take part in activities. meet with qualified childcare practitioners who can offer advice and support. socialise with other families in a more relaxed, natural way which helps to build supportive, positive communities.  We have useful information about starting a baby and toddler group. Support and advice for parents As a parent you are your child’s first and most important educator. Research shows that parental support for children’s learning has a direct impact on how well they do, both in early years settings and also later on in life, and it is widely recognised that the learning that takes place in childcare settings builds upon vital home experiences with parents. Information and advice The Alliance actively promotes and supports parental involvement in all our work. We offer impartial information and advice to help you find out more about care and education for young children, so you can make an informed decision about the childcare that is right for your child. We also support parents and children by offering affordable childcare provision, discounted books and resources, family learning programmes and adult training.

        "Description": "Early Years and Childcare Support is committed to working in partnership with all Early Years providers, Early Years Locality Teams and professionals to achieve the highest standards of inclusive, quality early years provision for children and families. Early Years and Childcare Support seeks to provide a range of activities and services by working with all early years providers and the county’s network of Children’s Centres, which aim to improve parent and child attachment, child development, school readiness and the prevention of escalation to specialist services. The government’s Early Help offer recognises that preventing problems or interventions as soon as they are identified is essential to support the development and achievement of children. Well targeted early intervention is likely to lead to better outcomes or improve a child’s resilience against poor outcomes. It is therefore critical that all Early Years providers across Lincolnshire are supported and challenged  to provide outstanding  inclusive, quality provision  for Lincolnshire’s youngest children in order that they all achieve ‘good’ outcomes at the end of the Early Years Foundation Stage and have the necessary skills to enable them to achieve their potential throughout school and their adult life.  Early Years and Childcare Support work in partnership with the Early Years Locality teams to provide the following services that contribute to the Early Help offer;  Promoting and supporting the early identification of children aged 0-5 years with additional needs and disabilities in order to improve outcomes. This is implemented by Early Years Specialist Teachers working closely with SENCos to ensure early identification and intervention for children and their families. Monitoring to ensure that effective early intervention and support for children and their families is provided in a timely manner. Support is given to settings to identify developmental delay in young children and provide additional support in a Children’s Centre or an early years setting to help children catch up with their peers. Providing support and advice to promote school readiness and a smooth transition into school, seeking to ensure that all children are ‘school ready’ and in a position to learn and achieve in a school setting. The key focus of the work is on the delivery of early intervention and transition groups to promote school readiness. Ensuring access to sufficient high quality, inclusive early learning and childcare for all children and specifically those aged 3 and 4 years of age who are entitled to the free Early Years Entitlement (EYE). In addition to this, the Service supports  the Local Authority’s duty to ensure the ‘Entitlement for Disadvantaged Two Year Olds’ is delivered to the most vulnerable families within the county and the allocation of Supported Childcare funding to vulnerable families. Supporting settings to identify workforce development and providing programmes for continued professional development to enable the workforce to meet identified priorities for Early Help and for early intervention strategies.  Services are available to all early years providers including early years settings, schools, childminders, Out of School clubs and within Children’s Centres across Lincolnshire. Services can be accessed through the early years provision identified above,  or on request by emailing EYCC@lincolnshire.gov.uk If you are struggling to find a place at a setting, please complete this form to let us know about it",

Some children, however just like to relax after school and do not want to join in with group activities. There is always alternative  options for these children. Some enjoy reading books whilst others enjoy independent play such as hama beads and working on a long term project. What ever your child’s needs on any particular day, we aim to meet them fully.   We have a buddy system in our provision and we encourage the older children to be buddies for younger children and also new children. This reinforces making relationships, kindness and interaction. Our Weekly Plan ​   The weekly plan is split in five different themes:           Monday - Games, Culture & Community         Tuesday - Creative Art & Expression         Wednesday - Gardening & Baking         Thursday - Performing Arts & Movie Making         Friday - Sports & Exercise        Afternoon Club and School Pick Up: 15:00 - 18:00 (3 hours)",

We recognise the important yet sometimes challenging role that parents have in bringing up and educating their children. We listen carefully and try to respond to the needs of our families supporting them in educating and cherishing their child. Pedagogy Our curriculum is based upon a high scope philosophy of learning. This curriculum approach has active learning at the very core, it is skills based. Children are guided to explore, interact and exercise their creative imagination through purposeful play. The plan, do, review cycle allows children to consolidate and share learning, the predictable routine and its repetitive nature allows children to develop secure knowledge and understanding, making links and pathways. Children are given ownership of their learning. We use key elements of the high scope pedagogy to deliver our curriculum. We aim to work with families, supporting them in educating and cherishing their child. We are an Outstanding Nursery school (Ofsted 2017). Within our school we have 64 morning spaces and 64 afternoon spaces - 24 of which are in our 2 year class (funded). Children of 3-4 are entitled to 15 hours of free nursery education and some families will be eligible for 30 hours of funded nursery education. These hours can be either taken over 5 mornings, 4 afternoon or full days. We also offer a breakfast session. We welcome children of all abilities within our school.       The school has met the standard for SFVS; Schools Financial Value Standard. Laura Cook is the Headteacher of our Nursery School. Jenny Fullerton is the school SENDCo (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities coordinator). All staff have attended/do attend training to enhance their practice and to become familiar with new research and guidance. This includes the Level 3 ELKLAN award - Speech and Language Support for the Under 5's. The nursery school ensure that we are approachable to all parents and carers. There is time for parents to speak informally to staff at the beginning and end of sessions about any issues they have or information they would like to share with us. We have termly meetings with parents to discuss their child's development and learning in the nursery school. Outside of these times parents can arrange more formal meetings with the staff if they need to discuss something in more detail.  If parents have concerns about their child's learning and development we would encourage them to firstly speak with their child's class teacher to try to work together to support them. If it is felt that additional support is needed above and beyond our quality first teaching then Jenny Fullerton, the SENDCo will be able to offer support and put in extra plans with your child's teacher and yourself. These extra plans may include 1:1 or small group work. If it is felt that we need extra advice beyond the school's expertise then we are able to contact outside agencies to support us. Jenny is able to make referrals to the Community Paediatricians and the Speech and Language Therapy Service. We sometimes work with Occupational Therapists, CAMHS, Physiotherapists and Specialist Nurse Trainers. As recommended by the local authority's special need team, a graduated approach will always be applied when supporting a child with additional needs. If it becomes apparent that after a series of support plans a child requires further specialised support, an application for an Education, Health and Care plan can be made.",

We are conveniently located on the outskirts of Grantham, near the A1. We are a member of International Education Systems – “IES”, with sister schools in Sidmouth, Devon; Cape Town, South Africa; Boca Ratan, Florida; Lisbon, Portugal; Panama City, Panama; Udine, Italy. The outstanding academic reputation and record of the school is based on the maintenance of traditional teaching methods nurtured by the devotion of our highly skilled and experienced teaching Staff. Our aim is to provide the best for all our children. We expect them to work hard to achieve as much as is within their reach; and then a little harder to achieve that which at first seemed unattainable. The happy, family environment, which we have deliberately created, enables us to encourage each individual child to reach his or her full potential in all aspects of our school life. Our rules and guidelines, designed to promote harmony and consideration for others, give our children a feeling of comfort and security, conditions in which they are more readily stimulated. Grantham Preparatory International School is geared to providing specialised tuition for all abilities and our strict limitation on the size of classes underpins this principle; all children, the gifted, average, dyslexic and the less able, receive individual attention. The children are prepared for Public School entrance examinations and for Grammar School selection examinations. Suitable pupils will be guided towards scholarships and given the opportunity to add their names to the lengthening list of our boys and girls who have already attained impressive scholastic awards. The education we offer is well-rounded and the school day is structured to meet all the needs of a child. Our days end with the emphasis on enjoyment. We like to send the children home happy. From 3.15pm to 4.00pm on most days, they are invited to choose from an extensive menu of extra-curricular societies and clubs. Up to fifteen different activities are organised and supervised every week at no extra cost to parents beyond that of raw materials which might be required. Within the framework of these activities, children can stretch their muscles, learn new skills and meet new challenges of their own choosing. Please see www.iesedu.com for further details about this independent international educational institution. We are members of the Independent Schools Association (ISA) and also members of the International Schools Association. The school was opened on its current site in October 1986 and in the academic year 2011/2012 celebrated its silver anniversary.",

It is our aim to have happy, independent children, who are confident in their play and learning. In our last ISI inspection report (2014) it was said that in EYFS there was a rich breadth of planned purposeful activities, both indoors and outside that enabled the children to develop and learn extremely effectively. The unit offers full and part time places for children. The EYFS Unit accepts children in the term after they are three and government funding enables the children to access five free afternoon sessions. This continues until the term after they have reached five years old. Prior to commencing, we offer 4 weekly half day Taster sessions and we visit the child’s existing nursery to discuss their progress with their key person. This aids a smooth transition into the setting. We run a key person system to ensure excellent communication between home and school and work in partnership with the parents to ensure children have a curriculum which not only meets their needs but also their interests. We have an excellent staff ratio and highly qualified staff who are supported by qualified and experienced assistants. All staff within the EYFS Unit hold paediatric first aid certificates. Children can access the outdoors all year round as the school provides warm and waterproof all-in-one suits for the children to wear. Attached to the unit is a large area covered by a canopy and on the school playing field there are several wooded areas in which the children have a den and climbing areas to explore and play in. The EYFS children also regularly use the school’s adventure playground and have P.E. lessons in the hall. Within the EYFS Unit there is an interactive whiteboard which the children can access or is used by staff to aid the children’s learning. There are planned sessions in the school’s ICT room and the children also have opportunities to use and play with different programmable toys, equipment and iPads. The EYFS children regularly visit surrounding places in the school mini bus for different learning experiences, such as a village walk, fruit picking at a local farm, planting at a nearby allotment, an indoor soft play area, and Belton House. The school offers a creche facility to help with wrap around care; it opens at 8am and closes at 6pm.",

        "Name": "Hartsholme Pre-school and Kids Club",
        "Description": "The Nursery Environment   What we have to offer your child Your child will have a busy time at Nursery with a host of stimulating activities to enjoy. Each session will operate within a framework of routine to help your child to feel comfortable and secure in their activities. The daily structure will also ensure that your child is exposed to a balanced curriculum. There will be a varied mix of free play group activities or staff led activities both in and out of doors. As your child gets older they will be guided through a slightly more structured learning programme that will equip them with skills that will enable them to start school with confidence.   Staff The staff at Hartsholme Pre-School will be selected for their individual talents and experience to form a successful team. The team will report to a full time Nursery Manager who will work closely with the Proprietor and area manager to maintain our high standards.   Key Person system Each member of staff will work with a specific age range. Within that age range staff will work more closely with a group of individual children.  The Keyperson system will encourage your child to develop a closer relationship to a specific person at nursery which can be reassuring especially in the early days. The key person will meet and help to settle your child at the beginning of each session and give feedback at the end of the session.   Where to find out what you need to know! There are two entrances to the nursery. One for the under 3’s and the second is for older children. The entrance lobby is a busy zone.  You will find all sorts of information here! Keep an eye on the parent notice board for updated information, weekly menu, fundraising events and Press cuttings etc. A dedicated member of staff will “Meet & Greet” all of the children.    For many of you it will be a race against time to drop off your child and continue on your way to work. Once your child has settled in with us it is likely that they will separate from you happily – but some children will always find it difficult to say goodbye. Please be reassured that we will telephone you to let you know that they have settled – or will be happy to take your call.   The Toddler Room Off the entrance lobby, this room acts as a base for the younger children. This is a space that the children can access resources that are more age appropriate for their stage of development. They can set something up and return to it at a later date without it being interfered with or pose a risk to the younger children.   There will be room for large scale items and also small world play, children will have free access to toys which will be at an appropriate level for them to self select. The children will be encouraged to tidy away the toys they have played with after they have finished.   The Pre-school room At the base of the school is our 3-4 year old room, it is a bright airy room with plenty of activity areas and fantastic outdoor space which is shared with the school nursery provision. There is also a dedicated cosy area so those children can have a well-earned rest. The Home Corner, reflects the current theme, be it a Doctor’s surgery, a shop, or a castle whichever takes the children’s interests. A music system will be available to reinforce other activities such as music and dance / movement.   There will be room for large scale floor play such as Construction, Duplo, or Miniature World play such as the Farm, Jungle world, Cars, Animal Hospital, or the Family Doll’s House. The room will also have the flexibility to host group activities such as singing, dancing and physical activities.   How we organize our day Upon arrival in the morning the children will be offered breakfast and a drink. The children are then guided into small groups according to their age and the ratio of staff to children. The ratios are; 1:3 for under 2 yrs, 1:4 for 2-3 yrs and 1:8 for 3+ yrs.      The children will then move around the different areas of the rooms and participate in the various activities in each area.        Wet and Messy Play / Creative area. This area will host the painting, water, sand, soil and clay play! In fact - anything wet or messy! A structured activity will always reflect the monthly theme. Aprons will be provided, however please do not send them in their best clothes.   Table-top areas When not used for dining, the area will be used for table-top activities. Weighing, measuring, small construction, snipping and sticking, playdoh and a host of other activities. Small group activities such as table-top games will be a regular sessional feature as well as puzzles, colouring and board games.   During each session a group of children will be involved in doing a food preparation activity. This may take the form of weighing out pasta, making cakes or biscuits, or simply counting out fruit segments.   Mealtimes We aim to make mealtimes a comfortable and social occasion when all the children can join together and enjoy their meal in a relaxed, yet disciplined manner. We encourage good table manners and the correct use of cutlery.   Meals for the children will be brought in for the children to enjoy healthy meals. Our aim is to provide food cooked from fresh, healthy ingredients. We follow a healthy eating plan and have our 5 a day fruit & veg plan in operation!   Food Allergies Due to the alarming increase of severe allergies in children today, it is nursery policy not to have any nut products on the premises. Other allergies will be discussed with parents and a suitable course of action will be implemented. Similarly, special dietary requirements such as vegetarian or cultural / religious restrictions will be catered for. If your child has been prescribed with an epipen / anapen please ensure one is on site at all times.     The Nursery Garden The outdoor area of the pre-school is split between the 2-3 area and 3-5 area, we also have access to use the school playing fields which is large and spacious and varied. The children will have their own vegetable garden, the produce of which will be used in the kitchen for their meals. The children will be involved with planting seeds, watering, weeding and harvesting from their garden.   We have various secretive seated areas around the garden for quiet and reflective moments. In fine weather the children will be outside as much as possible, even for a picnic tea! This area is shared with the School nursery so attachments can be building with the older age group from the start.   Outdoor Play The Ride-on-toy patio has a selection of trikes and vehicles. Other patio areas enable year round outdoor activities such as a chalk board, sand and water play.   All children will have the opportunity for outdoor free play and a structured outdoor activity during each session. We aim to encourage your child to accomplish a host of physical skills using their body and small apparatus.    Learning through structured play Whilst we endeavour to provide a learning orientated environment that will encourage participation in activities, I would like to stress that there is unlimited learning potential in structured play.   Whilst some children may enjoy from an early age a more formal approach like sitting quietly at a table some children do not. If this is the case, then we shall look for other ways to engage participation and to achieve the desired outcome. This may take the form of an outdoor activity or a more manipulative activity.   For example your child may be happier to write their letters in the sand with a stick than in a book with a pencil. If at the end of the activity they have learnt how to form and to recognise their letters then we have made progress. Your child’s happiness is paramount. If a child is happy then they will learn.   Planning our activities At the beginning of every month you will receive your invoice and a Newsletter. The Newsletter will inform you of the Themes for the coming weeks. If you are able to enhance any of our themes in any way – by bringing items into nursery, suggesting a relevant speaker or demonstration then we will be pleased to hear from you!   Themes will usually span a “half term” ie 6/7 weeks and will usually reflect the seasons, festivals and celebrations of the calendar as well as be initiated by the interests of the children. We follow an approach of Consulting With Children in our planning using Talking Tubs as a starting point. We follow the starting points of “Diversity” “Our Green World” and “A celebration of ME!” and then follow on from the children’s interests.   Getting the most from the Nursery experience By reinforcing activities at home, talking to your child about what they have done and are going to do, and bringing in items to show the other children, you will be greatly enhancing the learning potential of each nursery session.   When your child starts at nursery they will have an Individual Child Profile on Tapestry. All children will have observations added regularly. The observation will usually include photos of your child and might demonstrate a new skill, or perhaps an activity which your child particularly enjoyed. Please feel free to add photos and activities that you have been up to at home that you would like to share with us at nursery.   Government Funding for Two, Three and Four Year Olds The term following your child’s third birthday they will become eligible to receive funding towards their nursery education. In line with the National Curriculum, Hartsholme Pre-School will be following the guidelines for the Early Years Foundation stage. Some children aged from two years may also be eligible, please ask for more information.   The three primary areas of development are; Personal, Social and Emotional Development, Communication & Language and Physical Development. Four other specific areas of learning and development are considered and incorporated into nursery life. These are; Literacy, Mathematics, Understanding the world and Expressive arts and design.   Your child will be given the opportunity to develop the necessary skills that will aid a smooth transition into education. There will be activities which will specifically develop skills in listening, observation and memory.  There will also be a focus upon social interaction and personal independence.   The Child’s tapestry account will build into an interesting record of the time your child spends with us. If your child cannot communicate coherently to you about their day …we can!  I hope that you will agree that we promise to offer an excellent Day Care facility that your family and your child will enjoy and reap the benefits from!     I look forward to hearing from you soon!",

Tea is prepared fresh from our onsite cook Sonya, we understand that children have foods that they do and do not like so we allow children’s input into our five weekly menus to ensure we cater to a variety of tastes.  We have a specific Kids Club staff member who plans activities based around the children’s interest and what they request to do. We enjoy messy and creative play both inside and out with specific themed weeks based on the children’s requests, we have had a science week, nature week, Pokémon week, baking week and much more!

My setting is called Hippo Hollow Childcare Corner, Conveniently located on Monks Road near the hospital and Prison - on a main bus route and only a 15 minute walk into the town centre.   Why choose Hippo Hollow? I am an experienced, dedicated and trusted Child Care provider with 14 years service, offering a nurturing, home from home, environment where your child's happiness and safety are the top priority, from caring for babies to supporting school children before and after the school day and in school holidays I keep parents informed about their children's daily activities, milestones and any other important updates. I have an established reputation based on trust and relationships with the families I have helped. I provide a supportive network for families who may not have extended family to support them and I go above and beyond for my customers. I offer a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making parents feel instantly calmed and confident in my friendly and nurturing personality being the right person to look after their precious bundle.   I try to accommodate various work schedules if I possibly can. It's sometimes a bit of a jigsaw to fit people in around others and still stay within my permitted ratio of children permitted. I do recognise that no one works 9 - 5 anymore and shift patterns can be a tricky one to deal with but im always happy to try. Being a city based childcare setting means I dont have the large outdoor space a rural or suburban house may have, but every inch of our outdoor space has been maximised to provide a safe and versatile area for different play situations. This space is not just a garden, it's a blank canvas for providing an area for exploring and learning from growing flowers and plants to wildlife friendly elements and interchangeable activities that can be brought out or packed away depending on children's choices and curiosity. In addition we have 2 parks in close proximity where there are wildlife to see, ducks to feed and conkers to collect as well as safe space to run and play and enjoy the outdoors safely away from the limits of roads and traffic. My Last Ofsted Inspection was in February 2020 and I was again awarded GOOD in all areas. I am currently the only REGISTERED childminder available to serve Monks Abbey Primary school and provide a flexible before and after school service and pick up and drop off from Monks Abbey Primary School on Monks Road. Your child's journey starts here, become part of our extended family - Contact me now if you are seeking high quality childcare !",

From 7.45 am, we have a school breakfast club provision which is open to our Nursery children.  Local private nurseries can collect children after school if longer childcare is needed. Our children are given a healthy snack each session and freshly cooked school lunches can be ordered if required, or children can bring a packed lunch.  We have a fantastic, newly renovated outdoor space and our environment is planned to meet the needs of all the children in our setting. Our children are confident, happy learners who are eager to try new things and problem solve. We work closely with the school’s SENCO to provide support for children with additional needs and are able to meet the needs of all our little people.  Our staff are knowledgeable and friendly and have many years’ experience of working in the early years, to ensure children are ready for the next stage of learning.  We work closely with the Reception staff in school, ensuring a smooth transition into primary school.

A group of school Governors saw an increasing need for before and after school child care allowing parents to return to work knowing that their children are being looked after by trained, professional staff.  Within the Out of School Club we pride ourselves in offering a varied selection of games, sports, music and activities including multi-cultural activities.  All children who attend our school are welcome during term time and during the holidays children from other primary schools are welcomed.  We are registered for children aged between 4 years, up to and including the summer holiday after they have completed Year 6. For both the Jimmy D's Playgroup  and Out of School Club we have various ways you can pay for your child care, cash, cheque, direct debit or child care vouchers. If we are not already set for your voucher provider we can do this very easily.  Both of our settings are managed by a committee comprising of parents, school governors and staff. We always welcome new parents who wish to join our committee. Everyone has their own unique talents and skills to bring with them.   Jimmy D's Playgroup and Out of School Club will have places to offer your child in September as the older children in each setting will have moved on to the next part of their education.   If you wish to make use of either setting it is never too early to contact us to reserve a place for your child. If you need to contact us between 9.00am and 3.30pm you can also ring our Administrator on:    01778 382562. 7.45 – 9.00am and 3.15 – 6.00pm term time. 7.45am – 6.00pm school holidays.",

        "Description": "Welcome to Kids Corner Day Nursery Contact Laura on 01526 321388 Kids Corner Day Nursery provides high quality childcare for children aged from six weeks through to eleven years old. Learning for children is a rewarding and enjoyable experience in which they explore, investigate, discover, create, practise, rehearse and consolidate. If there is a stimulating environment, young children’s learning will be enhanced. Since the change in ownership in April 2013, Kids Corner Day Nursery has been undergoing a much needed refurbishment. We aim to provide the home from home environment, which Ofsted are now looking for. Our aim is to ensure each child can thrive and develop, be content in their surroundings, be stimulated and of course enjoy their days here. Our outside area offers a wide range of physical activities for the children including trike, scooters, push along toys, sand and water trays and so much more. We encourage the children to explore the environment by digging in the soil, searching for bugs and would also like to create a bug den. We have a planting area where the children have been encouraged to plant things and nurture them to see them grow. We have grown tomatoes, potatoes, sunflowers, lettuce, broad beans, spinach, rocket, rhubarb and so much more. We at Kids corner believe children should go outside every day come rain or shine, and therefore we ask parents to provide a spare set of clothes for their child in case they need changing during the day. During spells of good weather we like to take the children out for walks to the park or the local duck pond to enhance their learning further. Planning All the activities that are done with the children are carefully planned and reviewed daily to suit each child’s learning development and mirror their interests. The staff observe the children, noting their development and interests, so that they can plan to extend their knowledge, skills, attitudes and understanding.   Admissions Policy Kids Corner Day Nursery operates a Waiting list. Priority will be given to children     requiring full time care or are eligible to receive nursery funding or who have siblings   already in attendance at Kids Corner Day Nursery. Illness When your child is ill, please let us know as soon as possible, especially if the illness is contagious, like measles or chickenpox. If your child has vomiting or diarrhoea, they must be kept at home for 48 hours after the last bout before they return. This is to try and avoid the infection spreading throughout the whole nursery. If a child has been prescribed antibiotics they must remain at home for the first 24 hours. If your child falls ill or has an accident while here and if it is considered that hospital treatment is necessary but we are unable to contact you, the nursery will act in the best interests of the child and contact the emergency services immediately. Your Child will be cared for in one of our three age related play rooms: Babies Baby Room caters for children from six weeks to 2 year (or when confident with their mobility and starting to communicate clearly) in this room we feel the children learn best through sensory experiences. With this in mind children are given the opportunity to play in things such as jelly, baked beans, corn flour and many more. We are happy to adopt the routines you have put in place for your little one. Resources and activities are selected to encourage each child to experience every aspect of sensory development. Through the use of treasure baskets, babies are able to explore a range of natural and everyday objects, which vary in weight, size, texture, colour, smell and temperature. Activities are based around the three specific areas of learning from the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum. These are known as the prime areas (Physical Development, Communication and Language and Personal, Social and Emotional Development). Toddler room The Toddler Room caters for children from the age of 2 to 3 years. Children of this age group begin to show increasing independence in moving, communicating, learning through play and forming relationships with their peers. Activities and resources are selected to allow each child to develop and promote these skills. Activities are also based around the three specific areas of learning from the Early Years foundation Stage curriculum. Pre-school Room The Pre-school Room caters for children from the age of 3 to school. Children who begin their education in a learning environment that is purposeful, challenging and supportive stand the best chance of developing into confident and successful learners and we are committed to providing such an environment. Activities are based around the seven areas of learning, these will be planned, implemented and records of the observations made will be recorded in the children’s Learning Journeys which will be available for your perusal. They focus on the specific areas which include:  Literacy   Mathematics   Understanding the world   Expressive arts and design  In order for the children to develop in these areas of learning they will have achieved and developed in the prime areas (physical Development, Communication and Language and Personal, Social and Emotional development). Nursery Funding 15 hours Funded Childcare When your child is eligible for Pre- School we will deliver the Foundation Stage to your child and free nursery education sessions will be available for all eligible three and four year olds. These sessions are available at set times of 09.00am to 12.00pm and 12.00pm to 3.00pm each day. Each child can access five sessions per week, and up to 2 sessions can be taken in one day. Sessions are available during term-time only, for 38 weeks per academic school year (190 sessions). More hours can be accessed for full time care, and for this the usual daily rate will apply. Three-year olds who meet the eligibility criteria set by the Local Education Authority and who are born between 1st April and 31st August will be eligible for a free place at the start of the autumn term following their third birthday, those born between 1st September and 31st December will be eligible at the start of the spring term following their third birthday and those born between 1st January and 31st March will be eligible at the start of the summer term following their third birthday. (Please note: if your child takes up two sessions within one day i.e. 9-3pm an additional cost of £1.50 will be incurred for their lunch and snacks) 30 hours Funded Childcare  Please visit childcarechoices.gov.uk to apply for this funding. Parents must reapply for the funding every 3 months and if you are successful then you will be given a code which you will need to give to us to validate for that 3 month period. Without the funding code you will not be able to access the funded sessions. HMRC will email you when you need to reapply for funding. The 30 hours is based over 38 weeks of the year i.e. term time only, However as a setting we do not allow term time only contracts due to staffing contracts etc, so you’re your bill would be annualised for yourselves therefore not noticing the non-funded period. Our sessions for the 30 hours are as follows: Monday-Friday 7.30-12.30pm 12.30-5.30pm You can take the full 10 hour session if you wish. Meals and snacks will be billed to you at a cost of £1.50 per session, therefore if you choose to take two sessions in one day (10 hours) you will incur a cost of £3 per day for all meals and snacks provided, unfortunately due to health and safety regulations you will not be able to provide your own meals. Key Persons System In order to provide continuity of care, your child will be allocated a key person. The key person is responsible for each child’s wellbeing and they will ensure that information regarding your child is exchanged with you on a daily basis. They will provide for the emotional needs of your child e.g. to comfort and reassure in moments of upset or distress and ensure that account is taken of the child’s race, culture, religion, language and parental wishes. The key persons are also responsible for observations, record keeping and the monitoring of children’s progress. Records of these are kept in individual files called Learning Journeys, these are available for you to look at whenever you wish and will be handed over to you when your child leaves Kids Corner Day Nursery. Diaries are completed daily for children in the each of the rooms to inform parents of their child’s nappy changes, feed, sleep times and daily events.   The Minimum Staffing Ratios Are:   1:3   children under 2 years 1:4  children aged 2 years 1:8   children aged 3 to 11 years    Meals, Snacks & Drinks   Children attending full day care sessions will be provided with a morning and afternoon snack, a hot meal at lunchtime and a hot or cold afternoon tea. Breakfast will be provided for those children attending full time and morning sessions around 8:00am. All meals are included into the daily fee. Children attending either morning or afternoon sessions will be provided with a snack and either lunch or tea during their session, the cost of which is included in the fees. Drinks of milk and water will be provided for your children to help themselves to throughout the day. Babies will be prompted regularly throughout the day. If your child is being bottle-fed please provide made up bottles (water only), please also provide us with a named container of formula so that bottles can be made up within the nursery when it is necessary to do so. Indoor Foot wear For hygiene / safety reasons and to keep our flooring in a child friendly order we ask that all children who are able to walk, be supplied with named indoor soft shoes which should remain at the nursery in the winter months. Clothing Please send your children in clothes that you don’t mind getting paint, clay and dough on. All clothes should be named to save them getting lost. Please provide weather permitted clothes e.g. hats and sun cream in summer. Wellington boots, coats, hats and gloves in the winter. We go outside in all weather J We do have a supply of nursery clothes to borrow if your child gets wet or paint-covered. Please return them to us as soon as possible after using them, so others can use them too. Sickness and Medication Policy This is a \"well-child” care facility. If your child becomes unwell during their session  you will be contacted and asked to collect them. To keep other children and our staff free from infectious diseases we enforce an exclusion list. Parents/carers are asked to adhere to our sickness policy, which is provided when sessions have been offered. Parking of Vehicles Parents and carers are asked to park their vehicles in the designated parking area only. When we were granted planning permission for the nursery, North Kesteven District Council stipulated that NO vehicle is to park on the main road outside the nursery. If this policy is abused we will be given up to three warnings and then given a conveyance notice to vacate the premises within 6 months. Please help us to keep our nursery and your children safe! Please control your child during pick up times. Do not allow your child to run out to your car while you are still inside. The safety rule is that “no one goes outside without their parents accompanying them”. There is to be no parking on the grass verge outside the nursery for dropping off or collections.

CQC overall rating Good 24 October 2019 How does the service work? In Lincolnshire Domiciliary Care can only be provided by KIDS if it has been identified as a need through a social work assessment. Where families meet the criteria for support the allocated social worker will contact KIDS with details of the number of hours available each week and the care to be provided. We will contact the family and arrange a home visit. At this visit we will complete the necessary paperwork to ensure a comprehensive care plan is drawn up to meet the individual needs of the child or young person. We will at this point discuss when the family would like to receive the support. A Domiciliary Care worker will be identified based on the competencies required and an introductory visit will then be made with the family. Who is the service for? The service is for any disabled child or young person in Lincolnshire that meets the criteria for domiciliary care following a social work assessment. How much does it cost? The service is free to families as it is funded by social care. Times of service? This will be determined based on the individual needs of the family. How does my child access the service?

Our classroom is adjacent to the reception classroom, which  allows us to have a close working relationship with the  Reception class teachers, and for the children to become  comfortable with their future surroundings and school staff, thus enabling us to ensure  a smooth transition from Pre-School to school.  We have indoor and outdoor areas that are designated solely for our use, but are also  fortunate to have use of the school playground, the school field and the nature garden.  The pre-school is registered with Ofsted to take up to 24 children aged two to four  years. This allows us to have eight 2 year olds and sixteen 3 and 4 year olds.  We are open from 8am until 6pm Monday to Friday, all year round and also run a  breakfast, after school and holiday club for children aged four to eleven.  All of our staff are fully qualified, and work as a professional and cohesive team.  The curriculum we provide is carefully planned to cover all of the areas of learning and  is also differentiated to meet the needs, abilities and the interests of the children in  our care. While we ensure a structured day is provided for our children, we do  endeavour to be flexible in our approach and always offer a balance of adult led and  child initiated activities.  All children are assessed in line with the revised EYFS. This ensures that the children  in our care are making progress and ensures that we plan activities that will continue to  stretch and provide them with a suitable challenge.  The staff at Lea Pre-School work closely with all parents whose children attend our  setting. Forming good relationships with our parents is of great importance as it allows  us to provide a service that is tailored towards the families we serve. Our open door  policy means that parents are always welcomed into the setting, and their thoughts and  opinions are always welcomed and taken on board.",

The day begins with the children finding and hanging their name cards up on the tree to show they are at school. Then the children choose an activity to start at. When everyone has arrived, we gather together on the mat and welcome each other by singing and signing our Good Morning song. Then it’s back to play again! We play indoors and outdoors, and as soon as the children are settled and familiar with routines, we also explore the other wonderful spaces around our school. These include our brand new sensory room and extensive EYFS unit.  Each day includes plenty of singing with including nursery rhymes and number songs, and we love adding actions! Snack times and lunchtime provide opportunities for eating and talking together, and developing social skills. At times, the children work individually or in a smaller group with the teacher or teaching assistant on short tasks matched to their learning needs. Little Conkers  is a busy place, often noisy and messy, but sometimes very quiet! Just before home time we gather together for a story and share what we have enjoyed doing. Activities change and develop over the week in response to the children’s interests and learning steps. The children each have a personal online Learning Journey using software called Tapestry, which builds into a lovely record of their learning, including photos, comments and observations. Parents are able to view this and are encouraged to add their own photos and comments from home.  The children are encouraged to be as independent as they can, and to ask questions, explore and try things out for themselves. We celebrate every achievement and aim for every child to grow in confidence and to continue to be eager and excited little learners.",

Our setting: I own Little Star Childminding, I have been working as a registered childminder for 20 years. I work alongside my assistant and daughter Katy who has a degree in Early Years and Childhood studies. I live in uphill Lincoln close to the main routes in and out of the city which makes accessibility easy for parents to pick up and drop off children enroute to work/home. There is also a bus stop just a short walk from the setting. Our Ethos:I absolutely love the work that I do, it's not only fun but also extremely rewarding. I think it's the best thing in the world being able to help our special little people grow into even more amazing big people!I believe in providing a stimulating learning space for children to develop and learn. Children's learning and independence is of paramount importance and therefore to enable them to thrive in our setting, their learning is closely linked with their interests.I see being a registered childminder as a role which involves working closely with parents to ensure the best possible care for their child. I believe parents know their children best and try incorporate their practices as much as is possible when caring for their child. Experience:I have had much varied experience in working with children who have special educational needs and I have been lucky enough to be able to welcome numerous families within my years of childcare, which means I have lots of experience of working with many multicultural and multiracial families. All children are embraced and welcomed here and are made to feel loved and cared for. Our Home:Our home has a large lounge used for play, quiet time and homework (for the after school children), the conservatory leading from this which is where we store most of the resources and these are available to the children to access freely, this area leads to the garden with outdoor activities such as sand and water play, ride on toys and other garden resources. Activities and learning:I believe in providing all children with warm, safe,secure and 'homelike' environment. I enjoy doing fun activities which include: story sharing, arts and crafts, musical activities, outdoor play,free play, outings to local parks/places of nature and interest and much, much more!! Our activities are very much child led and I like to follow a child's interests to help them learn! Children in our setting are enabled and encouraged to choose resources and activities and the area in which they choose to play. It is my belief that children in a comfortable, caring and support environment grow and thrive. Early Years Funding:I am happy to be able to offer early years funded childcare for 2,3 and 4 year old children who are eligible, including the 30 hour funding. Please contact me for more information regarding this. I would love to hear from anyone who thinks they would like to become part of our setting!!Thank you!",

        "Description": "CURRENTLY OPEN FOR KEYWORKER CHILDREN - SEE NOTES FOR DETAILS  My Vision Providing an environment that is safe, fun and inspiring; where all children are exceptional. Who am I? I live in the little village of Skellingthorpe with my husband Alex, my 12 year old son Jacob, and my 10 year old daughter Evie May and our boxer dog Hetti and Frenchton Luna. We have been lucky enough to find our forever home, a lovely 1865 cottage situated in the village of Skellingthorpe. I love our new home and have lots of indoor and outdoor space for the children to play and explore. I have always wanted to pursue a career in childcare and finally achieved this by setting up my childminding business in September 2010. I have so far had the pleasure of looking after a range of ages starting from 6 months up to 12 years. Previously I have worked in the sport and leisure industry, where I progressed from being a gym instructor up to managing a private health club. This allowed me to work with both adults and children. I have also worked in America and the UK teaching children to swim. My last place of work was for a private educational company who provide training to teachers. I worked in the school development team, where I worked very closely with the schools CPD coordinator to establish the schools training needs. I recently achieved a Good with outstanding aspects in my latest Ofsted inspection. I am also a member of PACEY Meet the Family Me - Aka Lyndsay – When I’m not working I love to work out. I love playing netball with my fellow Bassingham Belles. I have recently started my umpiring journey, where I have just qualified at C level. When I’m not working out I love spending time with my family, cooking them tasty health food and playing games. Alex – Aka Daddy/Hubby – Alex spends most of his time at work. Alex works for Lincoln County Council in the Procurement department. When Alex is not at work he loves mountain climbing in the peaks, or snowboarding. Jacob – Jacob has just started at Lincoln Priory. When Jacob is not in school he likes to go climbing with his dad at the show room or somewhere in the Peaks.  Evie – Evie attends St Lawrence School, where she is in year 5. When Evie is not in school she love riding horses, attending Cubs, swimming and playing with her big bother. Hetti – Hetti is a 6 year old boxer dog. She loves wagging her tail, running around the garden, playing football with Jacob and Evie, eating, Sleeping, and having hugs. Luna - Luna is a 3 year old Frenchton, She is a French bulldog cross with a Boston terrier. Luna is a dog but smaller than a cat!! She loves chasing Hetti around the garden and pinching the odd toy from the playroom.",

Marshchapel Primary has its own nursery 'Little Sheep Marsh', ran by highly qualified teachers. As part of the federation, we also have a specialist learning mentor providing emotional, social and behavioural support. Marshchapel Primary is an all-inclusive school, where every child really does matter. We firmly believe that regular communication between school and home is vital when additional support or guidance is needed for a specific child; we have an experienced special need coordinator and dedicated members of staff, who will go the extra mile to find the correct journey for each child. Whether that be small group intervention, one to one sessions or a specific scheme of work to support their progress. Our teaching assistants provide invention, within the class setting, and are trained in relevant programs that again support special educational needs. Detailed and regular pupil progress meetings hold teachers to account, and when children are not making the progress expected, questions are asked and an action plan is put into place. We also have links to specialist services and outside agencies and will contact them as and when support and advice is needed. The school will then communicate this to parents/guardians. Although we are very careful about adding children to the special need register, we do identify children at an early age, and begin invention to support their needs. Within the nursery setting, we have specialist speech and language assistant through an Elklan t rained practitioner. Marshchapel is a small school and resources can be limited, but by being a part of the Fenland Federation, we have the expertise and resources across the federation that are readily available. At Marshchapel, we pride ourselves that all our children are given the education they deserve.",

At Monks Abbey Primary School Nursery, we offer an ambitious curriculum rich in awe, wonder and memorable experiences. We work collaboratively to provide a stimulating environment that provides exciting opportunities, promotes progression of knowledge and skills, challenge, exploration, adventure and a real love of learning. The Characteristics of Effective Learning for Early Years. underpin everything we do and we strive to ensure these are present in all aspects of our EYFS curriculum. In line with our whole school vision, it is our intent that all children develop physically, verbally, cognitively and emotionally in an environment which values all cultures, communities and people. We aim for our children to be confident and independent, to believe in themselves and interact positively with others. We use the overarching EYFS principles of Unique Child, Enabling Environments, Positive Relationships and Learning and Development when considering provision for our learners in order to ensure that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their starting point, gender, race, religion or background. We understand that play is an integral part of learning and this is at the heart of our EYFS curriculum. We believe a combination of adult directed and uninterrupted child-initiated play ensures the best outcomes for all pupils. Warm and positive relationships between staff and children, consistent routines and strong relationships with parents are key. We recognise the crucial role that early education has to play in providing firm foundations upon which the rest of a child’s education is successfully based.",

It is preferable for us to receive bookings at least a week in advance to avoid exceeding statutory ratios, However, we would always try to accommodate children in the case of an emergency. Timings  If you book a session and collect your child earlier than booked unfortunately we will not be able to give you a refund (unless you have contacted us before 1pm to advise of the change in collection time).  Children that are collected late when booked for a half session will be charged for the cost of a full session - £10 per child.  If you collect your child from a full session after 6.05pm then we are introducing a charge of £2, which will increase by £2 every 15 minutes.  We would be grateful if you could aim to collect your child for 5:55pm, as by the time they have collected their belongings and you have signed them out it is often 6pm.  If parents are repeatedly late then we reserve the right to refuse a place for that child in the future.  Because of food preparation and staffing ratios, if you book a full session and then collect your child/children earlier than booked you will NOT be given a refund.",

We are one of the best after school clubs and school holiday clubs in the Peterborough area.   We are thrilled to be celebrating our recent Ofsted report which rated us as ‘outstanding in all areas’ for a second time, a grading which was previously awarded in 2011, when we were also rated as outstanding in all categories. Children in Key Stage 1 are collected from the school and brought to the club by a member of staff. PlayZone promotes healthy eating so a healthy snack is provided.  The children choose their own healthy snacks and plan these on a weekly snack board. Children are encouraged to spread toast and make sandwiches to eat choosing their own fillings. The children have a range of both stimulating and quiet activities to choose from. Children are encouraged to help plan all our activities. Sometimes our activities will be connected with special events such as Christmas, Easter, Mother’s Day, Fathers Day, and Bonfire Night. We also have a vegetable garden where children grow fruits and vegetables which we sometimes include into our snacks.  We also grow sunflowers and other plants In some cases PlayZone can accept children from their 4th birthday.

        "Description": "We are a very central Nursery so we're handy if you use public transport and work in town. We have been open since 1990, so have a lot of experience in the childcare field. Green RoomOur Green Room provides a cosy and stimulating area for our youngest children. The small group of 9 children ensures that all children are provided with high quality care and each child is valued as an individual. As well as a large playroom, the Green Room has a separate sleep room. A cosy and quiet area away from the hustle and bustle of the main room. The Green Room routine is flexible to ensure that all children’s sleep and meal routines are considered as well as involving a number of stimulating activities to support individual development. We use treasure baskets, natural resources as well as Baby Babble time to ensure all children have access to a multi-sensory experience.  Yellow and Blue Rooms The older children are based downstairs and have access to two playrooms. Children can explore our sensory areas and water trays and also have access to role-play such as shoe shops, doctors or vets depending on their interests. We have a cosy corner where the children can have a rest or read a story. We encourage the children to develop personal and social skills and to become more and more independent. The children select their own resources and are actively involved in preparing their own snacks. Once a week the older children go on a trip in the afternoon and learn about our surroundings and our community. Trips include the cathedral, library, Collection Museum, shopping for fruit and vegetables at the market and to visit our friends at a local carehome.  Each child in all rooms has their own key person and this key person will plan activities based on each individual’s needs, development or interests. This means that each child has something that will interest them and motivate them to become active learners. Outdoors Our garden is large and spacious, and we ensure we provide children with the same quality learning experience that we provide indoors. We go out in all weathers and the children benefit from natural and open-ended large-scale equipment that they do not have access to indoors. We have a cosy corner where children can watch the birds at the bird table or have a story. A number of dens to explore as well as a digging area to search for worms or even treasure. We have a number of resources for children to develop their physical skills including bikes, cars, scooters and large wooden building bricks.",

The mornings a child spends in my care will tend to be quite active and will involve being out and about visiting places of interest, play areas or groups, or other childminding colleagues and socialising with their children. The afternoons tend to be more relaxed and spent usually within my own home with an element of educational and developmental activities.I will love and care for your child as I would my own children and provide them with the security and trust they would receive in their own home.

I am a fully qualified teacher with over 15 years of experience, specialising in the early years. I have always had a passion for learning and have found many ways to encourage and stimulate children to learn in their own individual ways. As every child is unique, their learning should be tailored to their interests as well as their individual needs. I am a middle child of four and have grown up with my siblings close in age. I remember from the age of 8 I developed an interest in other children, seeing the differences. I used to help with respite care for disabled children as part of community youth activity my church supported. I moved around the United Kingdom a lot as a child which enabled me to become adaptable to many situations, as well as experiencing different teaching methods at various schools. I am a married mother of 4 children, with over 18 years experience of both my own children and my 16 nieces and nephews. I learned very quickly, that as a parent, every child is completely unique, and so have developed many strategies to manage behaviour as well as encourage a love of learning in each of my children. I do not believe in violence of any kind, as all forms are detrimental to all parties involved. I teach through love, clear boundaries and teaching right from wrong. I have found every child who is loved and feels secure will soar in their learning because they will be instilled in a belief that they can succeed. I have a passion for children of all ages, and I enjoy spending time with a tiny baby as much as a babbling crawler; a frustrated toddler and an inquisitive chatterbox. I love to get to know all children that have been under my care and tutelage, and every child holds a place of fondness in my heart. I want to share my love and passion for the challenges of learning with every child I meet.",

However we welcome families from a variety of social & cultural backgrounds. The Preschool has been operational since 1989, moving to the current premises in 2004. We found it necessary to re-registered with OFSTED in 2014 as the New Life Church Ministries changed from an unincorporated charity to an incorporated charity.

We have purpose built premises with an amazing outdoor play area. There is a large sandpit, a canopied area, a playhouse,  gardening area, a tarmacked surface, a wild area. a sensory path, story telling area, a hill fort and a digging pit. We use the outdoors all year round where possible and are always looking to develop the opportunities for learning it affords. We work closely with parents and carers. This involves ensuring that staff are available for informal discussion at the beginning & end of sessions.  We hold regular Parents' Evenings & workshops for parents. We have close links with Sleaford New Life Church. Twice a year we hold celebrations in the Church Auditorium, at Christmas and at the end of the academic year. The children participate in musical presentations. Our strong community links include raising awareness of our local community larder and inviting visitors in from the local area to demonstrate skills and expertise in a variety of areas.

Each day children will have the opportunity for messy play, painting and other crafts, construction, small world play, role play, mark making, books, a relaxing cosy corner for resting, and outdoor play. Along with adult-led activities such as key group time and circle time, we ensure that your child is ready for the school environment.

We like to take our children out of the setting on occasions, for example a walk to the local shops to buy snack ingredients, park or beach. Risk assessments are carried out for these walks and can be located on our walls. Although our sessions are very flexible, we do have a routine as this helps children to feel settled. A few times a week, weather permitting, we have Beach School sessions. Our Manager has achieved a Level 3 Beach Schools Practical Skills and Environmental Management course which enables children to get the most out of being on the beach.

        "Description": "Did you know that sign language has been proven to be an effective form of communication for babies? If you consider the frustrations felt by babies then you'll understand the benefits signing can provide for both the parent and child.  Many children naturally use gestures and pointing but signing allows them to be specific about their needs. It takes the guesswork out and dramatically reduces frustration resulting in less stress for everybody concerned!  They can begin learning right from birth but won't have the dexterity to begin to sign until around four to six months. First signs are usually things that are most important to them such as 'milk'. This can then develop onto more complex signing as they grow such as signing 'teeth', 'hurt' and 'medicine' for when they have teething pain. The key to success is to reinforce the signs whenever possible and ensure the sign is used alongside the spoken word. The signs are not used on their own because the point of signing with babies is not to replace the spoken language but to enhance it. Many question the potential impact signing could have on the development of speech. You may be surprised to learn that signing not only encourages early speech but can also result in a wider vocabulary. Some wonder if the classes will be taught in the style of a typical lesson as essentially, they are gaining an education and skill. Sessions have been designed to be delivered in the most age appropriate way so songs, puppets, musical instruments and bubbles are used to enrich the learning process and create an atmosphere of fun. Children of all ages love doing actions along to songs but Baby Signing takes it a step further and teaches them something that will be of great use to them now and in the future.",

The community paediatric service provides a secondary service for children referred from primary care, hospital and community health professionals, schools and the local education authority when there are concerns about a child’s development, behaviour or educational needs. It is consultant led and doctors generally work within defined geographical patches. All are encouraged to have specific areas of interest/responsibility. Children are seen in a variety of settings i.e. clinic, school, hospital or home. There is close working with schools, Lincolnshire children’s services (education and social care) and other health colleagues. There are well-established links with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams. Child development clinics operate in Boston, Grantham and Lincoln involving multidisciplinary professionals and provide opportunities for joint assessment and coordination of services for children with more severe or complex developmental disabilities. Specialist clinics are also held for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the community and for children with hearing impairment at the local district general hospital. The community paediatric service also provides statutory support to Lincolnshire children’s services in relation to children with special educational needs and children being placed for adoption.  New Community Paediatric Referral Process – Schools   From January 2022, a new referral process has been put in place for the Lincolnshire Community Paediatric Service to help reduce the number of referrals rejected due to lack of detail and ensure children are placed consistently and fairly onto the appropriate pathway and in a timely manner.    Schools are expected to be the primary source of most referrals into the service. Schools are best placed to know the child's needs, and how these impact on their behaviours within school and at home. We have engaged with schools through workshops and communications to ensure they are aware of this. Lincolnshire GPs are being asked to re-route children, young people (CYP) and families to their schools for them to lead on making referrals to Community Paediatrics. For pre-school age children (0-4 years), GPs should inform the parent/carer to speak to a Health Visitor (01522 843000) and/or their Early Years Setting who can offer advice, support and signposting; or will support a referral to Community Paediatrics if appropriate. If a CYP is out of education, referrals can be made by a Health Visitor or Children and Young People’s Nurse (01522 843000) or a GP can make the referral if necessary. GPs will still make referrals into the service for CYP moving into area with a known need/diagnosis requiring follow up and babies/toddlers with complex medical/health needs, including genetic syndromes.    New School Referral Forms  The new, simplified referral forms will be the only form accepted for schools making a referral into the service from January 2022. Submitting a referral in an alternative format will result in the referral being returned and will lead to a delay in CYP accessing a service. Once fully completed, these forms should be emailed to LHNT.community-paediatrics@nhs.net",

Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with, and relates to, other people. It also affects how they make sense of the world around them. It is a spectrum condition, which means that, while all people with autism share certain difficulties, their condition will affect them in different ways. Some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support. People with autism may also experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colours. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism. People with Asperger syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language.",

        "Description": "Eczema (also known as dermatitis) is a dry skin condition. It is a highly individual condition which varies from person to person and comes in many different forms. It is not contagious so you cannot catch it from someone else. In mild cases of eczema, the skin is dry, scaly, red and itchy. In more severe cases there may be weeping, crusting and bleeding. Constant scratching causes the skin to split and bleed and also leaves it open to infection. Eczema affects people of all ages but is primarily seen in children. Those who “grow out” of their eczema during early childhood may see it recur again in later life. In the UK, one in five children and one in twelve adults have eczema while eczema and contact dermatitis account for 84-90% of occupational skin disease. Atopic eczema is a genetic condition based on the interaction between a number of genes and environmental factors. In most cases there will be a family history of either eczema or one of the other ‘atopic’ conditions i.e asthma or hay fever. Our confidential telephone and email Helpline is at the heart of our work, providing information, support and reassurance to people struggling to cope with eczema. Each year, thousands of people contact the confidential Eczema Helpline via email or telephone.

This team also includes Children's Occupational and Speech and Language Therapy. The team work across the county in a variety of settings with children and young people aged 0-19 years. Specialist Physiotherapists work with children and young people who have physical difficulties which affect the way they move. These difficulties  may relate to problems with  muscles or bones or may be related to injuries to the brain or nervous system. Exercises and advice regarding posture,balance or coordination may be required and  sometimes, in more complex cases, specialist equipment may be given e.g. to enable child/young person  to stand or walk. Children and young people at risk of developing postural problems are identified early through specialist assessment and along with the Children's Occupational Therapists advice and equipment may be advised to prevent complications such as tight tendons and hip/spinal problems happening in the future.. The physiotherapist will also advise on how to safely move and handle children ensuring parents carers and the child/young person are safe. Physiotherapists are also involved with children/young people who have long term respiratory conditions ensuring that the child/young person and carers are equipped to identify potential problems and manage them early in order to prevent having to go into hospital. The aim of the Children's Therapy team  is to help the child/young person reach their full potential through providing  appropriate intervention, advice and support.They do this by carrying out highly specialist assessments to identify the need and, in partnership with the child or young person; parents, schools or nurseries, goals are set and management options agreed upon. Options may be in the form of specific targeted work over a time period or advice and strategies integrated into their daily routine. The therapists do not work with the child or young person indefinitely but aim to empower them and their parents to become the experts in their own care seeking advice from the therapists when necessary. In working very closely with other professionals in health; education and social care such as specialist doctors and surgeons,teachers and carers the therapists can advise on ways to improve on movement.",

Badgers usually meet once a week for around 1 hour 30 minutes. Badgers take part in a wide range of fun activities based on essential first aid and other fascinating topics, earning badges and certificates for each one. For every three subjects a Badger completes, they receive an award until they achieve their Super Badger Award. To give each new Badger the best possible introduction, Welcome Badger provides a range of activities to ensure all new Badgers and their parents/carers are provided with all the essentials in the first few important weeks. Our Badger programme covers a wide range of subjects and activities, from first aid to communication skills, to healthy living and being safe. All the subjects have been written by St John people with the aim of Badgers in mind and to support children through their learning and development journey.

        "Description": "Did you know that sign language has been proven to be an effective form of communication for babies? If you consider the frustrations felt by babies then you'll understand the benefits signing can provide for both the parent and child.  Many children naturally use gestures and pointing but signing allows them to be specific about their needs. It takes the guesswork out and dramatically reduces frustration resulting in less stress for everybody concerned!  They can begin learning right from birth but won't have the dexterity to begin to sign until around four to six months. First signs are usually things that are most important to them such as 'milk'. This can then develop onto more complex signing as they grow such as signing 'teeth', 'hurt' and 'medicine' for when they have teething pain. The key to success is to reinforce the signs whenever possible and ensure the sign is used alongside the spoken word. The signs are not used on their own because the point of signing with babies is not to replace the spoken language but to enhance it. Many question the potential impact signing could have on the development of speech. You may be surprised to learn that signing not only encourages early speech but can also result in a wider vocabulary. Some wonder if the classes will be taught in the style of a typical lesson as essentially, they are gaining an education and skill. Sessions have been designed to be delivered in the most age appropriate way so songs, puppets, musical instruments and bubbles are used to enrich the learning process and create an atmosphere of fun. Children of all ages love doing actions along to songs but Baby Signing takes it a step further and teaches them something that will be of great use to them now and in the future.",

We aim to provide teaching methods, resources and learning opportunities that are adapted to meet the needs of all children • We aim to work closely with parents/carers, keeping them informed about their child’s learning and encouraging a partnership between home and school • Wherever possible, we aim to share learning objectives with all children, including those with special educational needs, to involve them in evaluating their progress and setting new targets • We endeavour to identify children with special educational needs as early as possible and review progress regularly in order to support their learning • We endeavour, through interventions and support, to close the gaps in learning with their peers, for the children on the special needs register. Working in Partnership with Parents/Carers: We believe that children do their best when staff and parents/carers work together. Parents/carers have a unique knowledge of their child and we encourage them to share this knowledge with the class teacher. Parents/carers are invited to review meetings, Parents’ Evening and to contribute to their child’s educational targets and plans? Information on outside agencies who support the school to work with individual children, is available from the SENCO/Headteacher. We can always be contacted for an appointment to discuss any concerns.",

We converted to an academy in September 2010 as a result of two consecutive Ofsted inspections grading us as an outstanding high performing school. The phrase: \"standards with a smile\" sums up the ethos of Branston. We believe in preparing our students for life through excellence in education and we are proud of our record of success in both examination results and in developing the personal skills and attributes of all the young people in our care. It is our aim to provide a broad and balanced curriculum. Classroom provision is in a range of buildings: single through to three storeys. Buildings are not attached and students move between buildings to access lessons; this can involve travelling distances of up to 350 metres and using staircases. The oldest Academy buildings were built in the 1950s and as such corridors are relatively narrow in places and some classrooms are compact. Surveys conducted externally and measured against responses provided by tens of thousands of parents and students nationally reveal that: Parents rate the school as outstanding overall and in particular praise : the quality of teaching, school discipline, the way we celebrate students' achievements, our image in the community and how we work with parents to support their children. Students of Branston, when compared to the national response, provided overwhelmingly positive feedback and in particular rated highly: teaching, discipline, the quality of our facilities, the development of confidence and community spirit. Once again the overall grading was outstanding. We have a strong and dedicated Additional Needs team who work collaboratively with our Student Support Officers, Pastoral and Teaching staff to provide all our young people with the support and skills needed to ensure they achieve all they are capable of.",

Breckenbrough is housed in a modernised Victorian country house with 10 acres of grounds in beautiful North Yorkshire. It has good access by road and is close to the mainline railway station at Northallerton. We make provision for day students and weekly boarders. All placements are for 38 weeks. Boarders have their own rooms and can access good social and domestic facilities. We work hard to provide a safe, calm environment where students can rebuild their self-esteem, develop appropriate social skills, become independent and succeed academically. We employ a full time registered psychologist and can provide other therapies such as speech and language, occupational, music and creative arts. On leaving, students successfully progress on to university, further education or the world of work.

Pupils join our setting for a variety of reasons including post-exclusion placements, intervention placements or for those who cannot locate a place within Lincolnshire adequate to meet their needs.  Bridge House additionally caters for students whom have more complex learning difficulties in addition to their behavioural, emotional and social difficulties including but not exhaustive of Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Autism, Dyscalculia and many co-occurring needs.  In addition to meeting a wide range of educational needs, Bridge House also specialises in providing a nurturing environment for those pupils joining us following periods of trauma and loss. Specialist staff work within nurture group classes to support those with attachment needs and difficulties.  Students make good progress as a result of good teaching and a carefully tailored curriculum offering academic challenge where appropriate and supportive of those who need time to settle back into education.  Assessments on entry are used to identify gaps in students’ knowledge and to plan programmes of support which are tailored to fit the student. Bridge House prides itself on supporting students’ who disengage from education or (for whatever reason) find themselves out of mainstream school. We place great importance in providing a full and balanced curriculum. This helps students to develop and prepare them for entry into young adult life. In short we believe it is fundamental to gain an education that is recognised in the real world and not place students at a disadvantage. We offer a mixture of GCSE’s and vocational qualifications, PSHE and independent careers advice; in addition to the emotional and behavioural support.

Through an inspiring and enriched curriculum, pupils are given the best opportunities to flourish and develop their God given talents.                 ‘With God, all things are possible’ Matthew 19:26 MISSION STATEMENT  We are an inclusive school and celebrate the diversity of the whole school community. We encourage every individual to thrive, tailoring care and support to the specific needs of individual children and their families. We work in partnership with our local church and diocese, and leaders ensure that the distinctly Christian vision is at the heart of all we do. We provide a broad and balanced curriculum for all children to encourage a love of learning, enabling all to flourish and creating opportunities for children to be confidently curious. We give children the confidence to challenge social injustice and equality on a global scale, within a culture of encouragement, endurance and aspiration. We provide opportunities for children and adults to express their differing points of view in a safe, respectful environment where all opinions are valued but where prejudicial behaviours are challenged. We ensure collective worship is invitational, varied and interactive allowing all to develop spiritually. We ensure the safeguarding of children and adults is a priority for all adults involved with the school.                              Together Everyone Achieves More We will endeavour to ensure that the needs of all children are understood and met as far as is possible, and this includes the needs of Looked After and previously looked after children. When it is clear that advice from outside agencies is required we will ensure that we are totally committed to gaining that help and guidance.  We are regularly involved with a variety of support agencies across a range of areas, e.g. Specialist Teaching Team, Educational Psychologist, Social Communication/Autism Outreach Support (The Working Together Team), Speech and Language Therapist, Behaviour Outreach Support Service are just some of the services we liaise with.

We have been awarded the Gold award from the Anti-Bullying Alliance 3 years in succession for our work on bullying and in 2019 we featured in the daily Star  as part of the positive work we do in this area.  About The School There has been a school in Butterwick for a very long time. In 1665 Anthony Pinchbeck left seventy-four acres of land to a group of people who were charged with the task of administering the land, renting it to farmers and using the rent to provide a grammar school for all the boys in the surrounding area and a house for the headmaster. On October 23rd 1876, under the Endowed Schools Act, the endowment of the school is devoted to Elementary Education - no longer a grammar school. The old building was to be adapted as an infant and girls' school and a new school built for boys, the cost of the new building to be £2,100. The first log book of the Girls' School had previously been that of Freiston National School. It contains among others these entries:  July 12th 1878. All the boys except infants leave Freiston School today and will join Butterwick boys on Monday next May 30th 1879. Today closes the school year as well as the career of the Freiston National School June 2nd. School transferred to Butterwick under the name of Pinchbeck's Endowed Girls School - 37 children admitted  In 1961 with the building of the Giles School, the children aged 11 were transferred there. The two Butterwick Schools combined under one Head Teacher, Miss D Calthrop, with the infants using the Boys’ School and the juniors using the Girls’ School. The Governors had a new building constructed, combining both groups of children in 1973, with 5 classrooms. There are now 13 classrooms. Until 31 December 1993 the school was Church of England Voluntary Aided. On January 1994 the school became Grant Maintained with no change in the School's Christian Foundation. A purpose-built Nursery Unit was opened in April 1998, admitting children the term after their fourth birthday. With the abolition of Grant Maintained status, the school returned to being Church of England Voluntary Aided in 1999. In 2009 the pre-school moved from the Old Girl's School site into a newly extended Nursery Unit on the main school site.",

        "Description": "The school is at the heart of the local community, it encourages diversity, and promotes inclusion within a selective setting, adding real value to a learners’ educational experiences. The Governing Body recognises that all students have their individual special needs and that, as far as possible, the teaching styles and the curriculum of the school is arranged that these needs are taken into account. It is the policy of the Governing Body to give students access to the support of whichever agencies are appropriate whenever they have a perceived need, whether such students are receiving additional funding through the local authority for that need or not.  The school works in close co-operation with a whole range of external agencies involved in the support of such students as well as those funded or commissioned by Lincolnshire County Council.  These include support services such as Early Help, the Behavioural Outreach Support Team (BOSS), the Sensory Education and Support Team, the Virtual School, the Working Together Team, an independent Educational Psychologist and ABCDyslexia. Where students live in Nottinghamshire we will access the appropriate services from that authority.  The Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) holds the NASENCO qualification. The SENCO accesses the Lincolnshire County Council Special Educational Needs Team briefings and the school follows the recommended protocols for the assessment and support of need such as the Valuing SEND tool. The SENCO also oversees staff training to ensure that staff are equipped with the relevant knowledge and understanding to support their students.  There are definite advantages in the fact that Carre’s is a relatively small school. Teaching groups are manageable in size, promoting excellent teaching, and form groups do not exceed 30. Consequently, Form Tutors have the opportunity to get to know their forms well. In all cases the Form Tutors are responsible for the general welfare of the students and it is to them that the students go in the first instance if problems arise. Morning registration periods provide regular opportunities for staff and students to talk about matters of mutual interest and concern and the three dedicated progress review sessions with form tutors allow the tutors to monitor and support academic progress. Each team of year group tutors is supported by a Head of Year who knows the needs of the year group without having the responsibility for a specific form. The Heads of Year are supported by the Deputy Head and SENCO in planning and providing for support needs. The Pastoral team is further supported by an experienced Student Support Team, a team of non-teachers, under the direction of the SENCO, who offer targeted support for students, both as individuals and groups in our dedicated learning support unit as well as in the classroom. Each member of the Student Support Team has developed expertise in specific areas of need. In charge of overall pastoral arrangements within the school is the Deputy Headteacher. He, along with Heads of Year, Pastoral Leaders and the SENCO, is responsible for ensuring that ongoing problems or needs are dealt with as effectively as possible. The pastoral team arrange meetings with parents and staff, initiate contacts with parents where the school is experiencing difficulties with individual students, liaise with the county’s specialist services and organise supportive measures for students where these are judged to be appropriate. Students thrive under positive relationships and a constructive learning environment. A rewards system is followed to give incentives for positive behaviours. The rewards systems are overseen by the Heads of Year. We pride ourselves on our support for mental wellbeing and achieved the Wellbeing Award for Schools in April 2019. Two members of the Student Support Team have pursued specialist training in teenage counselling and CBT. They have also completed the Applied Suicide Intervention and Skills Training (ASIST)workshop. We refer students to and work with NHS services such as Healthy Minds and CAMHS as well as the Lincolnshire Centre for Grief and Loss. We also access the services of a local counsellor for both the supervision of the Student Support Team as well as for individual students.  We have established a good reputation for supporting high functioning students with ASD and our submission for the Autism Inclusion Mark was awarded Good Practice by AIM4Lincs in 2017.",

The social and economic backgrounds of children are varied. Currently there is one child with English as an additional language and 3.5% from various minority ethnic groups. From January 2014 there are 143 children on roll, split into six classes of single year groups except for Year 1 children who are split between Rec and Y2.  There are 7 teaching groups for maths for this academic year. Attainment on entry: The school uses Early Years Foundation Stage Profile Data to give details of attainment on entry, which shows that the majority of children are  working within the 40 – 60 m stage, although this varies from year to year as there are small cohorts. Children attend school for three sessions in the Summer Term prior to entry which enables staff to make observations which inform initial assessments. Staff at school are also able to have some discussion with pre-school staff and parents and also spend the year visiting the local pre-school making joint observations with their staff. Our aim is that all children will attain the highest possible standards, that they will receive a well-rounded education, giving them the opportunity to become positive participants in the local and world community. We expect that all children will become independent thinkers with a lifelong love of learning. We provide a fully inclusive education, valuing each child and fostering good relations between home and school. Children enjoy school, listen carefully and generally behave well. (Pupil Questionnaires) At Caythorpe Primary School we have a caring, Christian ethos which is enhanced by strong links with the village church, with regular services, which are well attended by the community. The school runs a successful Breakfast Club, caring for children from 8.00 am every morning. Although this is provided for busy families, a sign of its success is that some children choose to come even though their parents are not working. We have been part of a local Extended Schools partnership which has enabled us to extend further our wide range of extra-curricular activities. These are planned in blocks throughout the year, some of which take place after school. These include netball, football, craft, computers, stamp collecting and drama. We offer a wide range of Arts Activities throughout the year, as part of the curriculum, as special events and as part of our extended school’s offer. We are currently renewing our Arts mark Award. In 2012 we achieved the Basic Skills Quality Mark for the fourth time. We have formed a collaborative partnership (AQT Achieving Quality Together) with other local schools, Ancaster, Navenby, Our Lady of Good Counsel and Welbourn primary schools.  This has been formally formed for over two years and has included many events such as launch evening, with guest speaker, logo competition, creating a song and lots of other joint opportunities, particularly for G&T pupils and CPD. We are also in a larger cluster which includes 10 schools and we undertake a wide variety of opportunities such as, staff expertise, use of School Business Managers, networking, and sports. We are one of a cluster of schools working in partnership with Carre's Grammar School (Specialist Sports College) which gives us opportunities to access training, advice and resources to promote an active lifestyle. It involves many sports for the children and encourages physical activities during playtimes. We achieved Healthy Schools Status in 2008 and have achieved Enhancement of this status in 2012. In addition to advocating a healthy lifestyle we hold Healthy Schools Days annually. It has also led to the development of a School Travel Plan which, in turn, has led to several successful Bikewise Courses. ‘Bikeability’ tuition was introduced in September 2011 as well as ‘Bikewise’ which has taken place for over 20 years! We have also renewed ‘Rooted in reading’ award 2011 and have the FA football charter and ‘Active Mark’ We regularly host students on placement from Bishop Grosseteste University College, with whom we work in partnership. There is usually at least one NVQ student working in school and several work experience pupils, depending upon the time of the year. Parent/grandparent volunteers are welcomed into school and provide extra support throughout the school on a regular basis. Year 6 are taught as a single year group, where possible. The impact of this, as observed by staff and parents, has been an increase in independence and their ability to work as collaborative learners. All children are taught in single year groups for Mathematics and since February 2012. Currently there are many, small groups for phonic development throughout the school, enabling children to focus on their specific needs.  The impact of this has been very positive. ICT hardware is plentiful. Each class has their own interactive board and at least two additional computers.  The ICT suite/library also offers 15 networked computers to be used as either whole class or group work. The LA judges the school to be Grade 2; standards continue to improve which is challenging with inconsistent cohort sizes.  But we strive to do our best in terms of both attainment and progress. Staffing structure continues to evolve, depending upon the needs of the school.  There is now a Headteacher, Deputy Headteacher and Senior teacher, alongside 4 other full time class teachers and three experienced part time teachers. Around 20% of the school is on the SEND register ranging from moderate learning difficulties to diagnosed autism, plus physical needs.",

        "Name": "Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) Scheme",
        "Description": "What is the CHIP scheme? The CHIP scheme aims to help Lincolnshire families keep their children safe from home accidents. Accidents in and around the home are a leading cause of preventable death and disability for children under 5 years old. How does the CHIP scheme work? Home safety interventions that include a combination of home safety assessment, parent education and provision and fitting of safety equipment can be effective in preventing child accidents in the home.  The CHIP scheme provides a range of resources to staff and volunteers working with families so they can support families with accident prevention. There's also an equipment fitting service that families can be referred to if they need safety equipment. CHIP Assessment The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that homes with children under 5 have a 'structured home safety assessment' to identify and address any child injury risks in the home. The purpose of the CHIP assessment is help practitioners:  take a systematic approach to identifying child injury risk in the home give consistent safety advice according to the latest evidence, and keep a record of identified risks and the action taken to mitigate them.  The assessment looks at risks associated with developmental milestones as there's a strong link between the types of accidents children are involved in and their stage of development. It also takes a Sign of Safety approach, encouraging families to think about what's working well and what actions can be taken to make their children safer. The CHIP assessment can be downloaded at the bottom of the page. It comes with a guide containing all the safety messages relating to each question on the assessment.  You can complete the assessment online and on submission a copy will be sent to your email address. It's also available on Mosaic so it can be added to a child/family's record. CHIP Training Parent education plays an important role in preventing child accidents in the home. Staff and volunteers working with families are in a great position to educate parents and carers about child injuries and how they can be prevented.   The CHIP e-learning module is a must-do for anyone who works with children under 5 years of age or supports families with children under 5. It takes around 20 minutes and by the end practitioners will be able to:  Identify what causes the most common and serious injuries in the under 5s and what can be done to prevent them Explain the link between child development and injuries Find useful resources to help you prevent accidents.  Here's how to access the course:  Go to: https://safeguardinglincolnshire.vc-enable.co.uk.  Instructions of how to register are attached. Click 'Learning' Click 'Available learning' Type 'Chip' into search bar. 'Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) E-Learning' will appear Click 'Start' and then click 'Start' again Click 'Download' and then open the PowerPoint Click 'Slide Show' once in the document and click through it using the mouse or spacebar Once finished, click 'Next' in the e-learning site and it'll take you to a quiz. Complete the quiz to gain a certificate.  CHIP Visits Click here to refer. Please read the information below before referring.  Be aware that the fire service is operating a reduced home visiting service at the moment, and only high risk cases will be considered for a CHIP visit. You can submit your referral and the fire service will make arrangements to visit once services return to normal. If you feel that the case is high risk – i.e. there's an imminent and high risk of child injury and the installation of equipment can reduce that risk – then please email chips@lincolnshire.gov.uk with your referral with further information. CHIP Visits are provided by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue (LFR). Upon referral, LFR will visit the household and supply/fit safety equipment as necessary. This may include:  Safety gates (to prevent access to and falls on stairs) Window restrictors (to prevent falls from windows) Fire guards (to prevent access to open fires) Cupboard locks (to prevent access to cupboards containing medicines and poisonous household chemicals) Blind cord cleats (to prevent access to blind cords which could cause entanglement and suffocation) Hair-straightener pouches (to prevent burns from hot hair straighteners)  They will also undertake a home fire safety check which includes escape planning with the family and installation of smoke or CO alarms, if needed. Referrals for CHIP Visits can only be made by Early Help Workers, Early Years Practitioners, Health Visitors, Family Health Workers and Social Workers. The referral form will ask for a copy of the household's CHIP Assessment. This demonstrates the need for equipment and evidences that home safety has been discussed with the family. It’s important to note that LFR's responsibility is to assess for and fit safety equipment according to manufacturer's instructions and best practice. It is not LFR's responsibility to educate parents about accident prevention – this is the responsibility of the referring practitioner. Evidence shows that the provision and installation of safety equipment is only successful in preventing injuries when combined with parent education. The CHIP e-learning and assessment tool are designed to support practitioners with this. CHIP Visits are targeted at households where children are at greatest risk of injury. The following characteristics indicate that a child may be at high risk:  They live in areas of deprivation They live in rented accommodation, poor quality housing or homes of multiple occupancy Their parents are unemployed or have never worked Their parent’s ability to supervise is impaired (i.e. due to mental health problems, health/care needs, substance misuse, number of children in property) They have young or single parents with poor support networks Their parents can’t afford safety equipment.  The following eligibility criteria is therefore applied. The child/family must be on:  Child protection plan Child in Need assessment/plan Early Support Care Co-ordination (ESCO) Team Around the Child (TAC) plan Income Based Jobseekers Allowance; Income Related Employment Support Allowance; Income Support. Also including Universal Credit Working Tax Credits or Child Tax Credits Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit  Some points to consider before referring:  Ensure you have consent of the parent/carer If the parent/carer is a tenant they will need to have permission from their landlord Be aware that LFR will not install safety gates unless there is a child aged less than 24 months in the property You will be notified with details of action taken during the visit. Please retain this in the child/family record.  Useful resources Child Milestone Cards. Lincolnshire County Council has produced 6 child milestone cards for families to remember and celebrate their child's first developmental milestones (see Downloads). On the back of each card is advice on how to keep children safe from accidents as they grow and learn new skills. They can be used for displays and campaigns or as teaching resources in one-to-one or group sessions on child safety. When professionally printed they make a great gift for families.   Public Health England's Preventing Unintentional Injuries Guide is for all staff working with children under 5 years and covers data, actions for practitioners and safety messages for parents and carers. The Keeping Children Safe at Home research programme, led by University of Nottingham, has produced an Injury Prevention Briefing with ideas for activities, education and training for practitioners working with children and families. The Lullaby Trust has excellent, easy-read safe sleep resources. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Parent Hub has advice for parents on keeping their under 5s safe. The Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT) is the UK’s leading charity working to reduce the number of children and young people killed, disabled or seriously injured in accidents. Below in the downloads is a safety messages card game and answer sheet. This is a good game to play with parents and teaches about potential risks and how to reduce or eliminate them. Print off the sheet, cut into cards, shuffle and get people to match the hazard with the correct safety advice. Further information Please contact chips@lincolnshire.gov.uk.",

        "Description": "Who we are: Choices College is a specialist post-16 College providing person-centred, individually tailored supported internships to young adults with learning difficulties, disabilities and/or Autism. Through the internship, 16–24-year-olds gain work experience, develop independence skills and increase their employability.  What we do: Our service is bespoke, offering tailored support to each intern, and employment opportunities are matched to the individual’s skills. Choices College aims to empower interns and build their confidence as individuals in the workplace, while also offering life experience beyond their home and school environments. The course allows them to prepare for adulthood, independence and life beyond education. The programme aims to provide young people with the skills and opportunities to enable them to progress into paid employment at the end of the year-long internship programme, working within a wide range of public, private and independent sector businesses.  What is the engagement process? Choices College holds formal awareness sessions at schools and other local authority venues, but we are also happy to come and speak with interested young people and parents and/or carers in other settings, e.g. at home or school on a one-to-one basis.  Who can apply for the internship? The internship is for 16–24-year-olds with learning difficulties, disabilities and/or autism. There are no academic requirements to join the internship, however individuals will need to have an aspiration to work and a current Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). Choices College will need to be named in the EHCP, so parents/carers will need to discuss this with the local commissioning authority.  What is the assessment process? Potential interns will be invited to a fun day for us to meet the young person and assess whether Choices College can meet their needs.  How long is the internship? The internship comprises up to three placements, lasting 10-12 weeks each, throughout the academic year. Students who successfully complete their internship will leave the college with an employability qualification accredited by NCFE, along with a maths and English qualification at a level higher than previously achieved.  What support is provided? Interns are supported by a Workplace Mentor, Project Coordinator and a Project Manager.  What kind of work experience roles are available to interns?

I’m so proud of myself, I want to keep working”  Parents and Carers: “The Choices College Team have gone the extra mile to help him, and I can’t thank the programme enough for helping him make steps to increase his chances of not just having a job, but of reaping all of the benefits that having a job bring” “We are very grateful to Choices College for the very caring and down-to-earth way they have provided for our daughter who has moderate learning disabilities and is on the autistic spectrum.

He has a purpose, and it has transformed his life.”  Employers: “The student we have worked with fitted into the office atmosphere with ease. It was a great experience for both us and for him too. It was a pleasure to see his confidence grow as he became more involved in the day-to-day operations” “Without exception, Choices College students have showed an unparalleled work ethic.  The time invested in their training has shown dividends in the department and it has been a pleasure working with them”",

We’re devoted to engaging and impacting one another, believing that Jesus himself set an example of service and that we’ve been given the responsibility to follow it. What do we want to achieve for Claypole School?  We aim to be an inclusive, caring school where we can give everyone the time and support they need to develop; building a confident, resilient, responsible and spiritually healthy community of people.  We strive to do our best for ourselves and each other, challenging and guiding one another – opening minds and widening horizons – working together towards the flourishing of all members of our school community so that everyone can fulfil their potential through the provision of world-class education. We believe that all children no matter where they live or where they're from deserve a chance to achieve, a chance to succeed and to be given another chance. This matches our motto: Believe & Achieve (from Matthew 21:22). We work at Claypole C of E Primary because we want to make a difference to the lives of the children in our school. What we want for every child in this school is:  To leave this school with a lifelong love of learning. To want to know “Why”- to be curious as to how the world works. To know what the world looks like & where things are. To know why things happen To know why we are who we are. To be confident enough to grab opportunities if they come their way – not to be scared to have a go and fail. To leave school having found their talent.  We want them to look at the world and be thrilled by it, see its beauty and feel its power. We want to give children an opportunity in life to achieve and to have a love of learning. We believe that creativity is as important in education as maths & literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. We believe that a child has more than one chance in life – give them that love of learning, an enquiring mind, that awe and wonder and they can achieve. This is in keeping with the Church of England Vision for Education: ‘enabling children and our community to flourish as they experience our education for wisdom, hope, community and dignity; and to discover life in all its fullness which Jesus offers’ preparing the children to use their gifts and abilities effectively to follow God’s plan for their lives. How can we give children a love of learning?  An exciting curriculum that inspires children and drives aspiration Quality, inspirational teaching Teaching that challenges them and pushes them Teachers that don’t make up excuses for them  All in an environment that is inclusive, caring, challenging but fair, compassionate and forgiving, and where everyone is treated with respect – we believe that Jesus himself set an example of service and that we’ve been given the responsibility to follow it so that we can flourish. We celebrate the gift of imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are… our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. We may not see this future, but they will; and our job is to help them make something of it. In order to achieve this, there needs to be a commitment from everyone (staff, parents, governors...together) to inspire, to challenge, to care for all those in our school, a desire to make a difference to the lives of those in our care with no exceptions and no excuses. We strive to provide a stimulating and challenging learning environment. We believe that our holistic approach to developing children academically, spiritually and personally provides every opportunity for each pupil to achieve their full potential. High expectations and high quality learning experiences based on individual needs enable every child to feel valued and to be and do their best. We believe that we are distinctive in seeking excellence through our creative, interactive and exciting curriculum within our caring Christian values & vision and our community.",

        "Description": "Community paediatrics in Lincolnshire is part of a combined children’s service provided by United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust. The community paediatric service provides a secondary service for children referred from primary care, hospital and community health professionals, schools and the local education authority when there are concerns about a child’s development, behaviour or educational needs. It is consultant led and doctors generally work within defined geographical patches. All are encouraged to have specific areas of interest/responsibility. Children are seen in a variety of settings i.e. clinic, school, hospital or home. There is close working with schools, Lincolnshire children’s services (education and social care) and other health colleagues. There are well-established links with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams. Child development clinics operate in Boston, Grantham and Lincoln involving multidisciplinary professionals and provide opportunities for joint assessment and coordination of services for children with more severe or complex developmental disabilities. Specialist clinics are also held for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the community and for children with hearing impairment at the local district general hospital. The community paediatric service also provides statutory support to Lincolnshire children’s services in relation to children with special educational needs and children being placed for adoption.  New Community Paediatric Referral Process – Schools   From January 2022, a new referral process has been put in place for the Lincolnshire Community Paediatric Service to help reduce the number of referrals rejected due to lack of detail and ensure children are placed consistently and fairly onto the appropriate pathway and in a timely manner.    Schools are expected to be the primary source of most referrals into the service. Schools are best placed to know the child's needs, and how these impact on their behaviours within school and at home. We have engaged with schools through workshops and communications to ensure they are aware of this. Lincolnshire GPs are being asked to re-route children, young people (CYP) and families to their schools for them to lead on making referrals to Community Paediatrics. For pre-school age children (0-4 years), GPs should inform the parent/carer to speak to a Health Visitor (01522 843000) and/or their Early Years Setting who can offer advice, support and signposting; or will support a referral to Community Paediatrics if appropriate. If a CYP is out of education, referrals can be made by a Health Visitor or Children and Young People’s Nurse (01522 843000) or a GP can make the referral if necessary. GPs will still make referrals into the service for CYP moving into area with a known need/diagnosis requiring follow up and babies/toddlers with complex medical/health needs, including genetic syndromes.    New School Referral Forms  The new, simplified referral forms will be the only form accepted for schools making a referral into the service from January 2022. Submitting a referral in an alternative format will result in the referral being returned and will lead to a delay in CYP accessing a service. Once fully completed, these forms should be emailed to LHNT.community-paediatrics@nhs.net",

We are a much smaller than average primary school with three classes, serving South Holland, Lincolnshire. Our caring, family ethos is very important to us.

This ensures that the classes are of a similar size. The largest class is 15. This teaching and learning arrangement will be reviewed annually to reflect the needs of the school. Mixed - aged classes offer children a wider range of abilities within each class and our experience shows us that this enables children who do find learning difficult to work alongside others with a similar level of achievement. Class teachers and teaching assistants learn with the children for at least two, possibly three years and so there are excellent arrangements for continuity.

We offer a high level of care and education for vulnerable children with emotional, behavioural and associated learning difficulties, particularly students with autistic spectrum disorders. It is expected that these children will already have experienced difficulties in school, community and/or home and will require individualised care and education. We offer a high staff to student ratio in a friendly and stable environment. “Students make excellent improvement in the management of their behaviour and readiness to learn as a result of high expectations and good relationships with the staff.” – Ofsted 2013 We focus on building self-esteem and positive relationships. Our success will be measured not just by improvements in academic ability but also in terms of social and emotional improvement. Students are encouraged to participate in setting their own challenging but realistic targets and to celebrate their achievements. “Students’ ability to work independently makes a major contribution to their rates of progress, particularly among older students.” – Ofsted 2013 We encourage families and carers of our students to work in partnership with us to support their children’s progress and strengthen relationships. Demeter is the mythical god of the Earth, the Earth Mother. The story goes that when her daughter Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, Demeter stopped caring and the world started to die. The other Gods had to intervene, a plan was discussed and a compromise was reached. Spring arrived and the Earth was reborn. This story of compromise, discussion and new beginnings seemed relevant to our establishment and the goals we are aiming to achieve. We hope that every child in our care will feel supported through an individualised educational programme. “The staff know their students well and provide a high standard of care and challenge to enable them to learn in a secure and safe environment.” – Ofsted 2013 Our aim is to equip our students with the skills they need to experience success in all areas of their lives to ensure a brighter future. Aims • Help young people develop their self esteem through activities that promote self confidence and encourage their development. • Help young people stay out of trouble by adopting a positive approach to anti-social behaviour. • Actively involve the views and opinions of the young people in the day to day running of the school. • Gain the confidence of families by involving them in decision making and maintaining regular contact. • Promote and develop opportunities for integration into the local community.",

We also offer a Creative Pathway where students can gain skills in both visual and performance art.

At Derwen College we believe that students develop their independence best when they work on it in a real environment. Students develop independence and travel training skills whilst carrying out everyday living tasks with the support and guidance of care staff. The aim of independence is to enable students to grow in confidence in living as independently as possible.

We believe that actively involving parents in their child’s early learning contributes positively towards their long‑term development. Our approach From the very beginning, we recognised the value of learning through play and the important role of parents in this process. The benefits have been acknowledged by Government and addressed in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. We continue to lead the sector in this area by delivering services which use play to promote learning and development. Baby and Toddler groups Baby and toddler groups, or stay and play sessions, are extremely popular with young families. We offer practical advice and support to over 2500 groups and deliver quality baby and toddler sessions to thousands of families every year. The benefits of these groups are enormous. Parents, babies and toddlers can:  enjoy positive and playful time together in an informal, friendly space. use a variety of resources and take part in activities. meet with qualified childcare practitioners who can offer advice and support. socialise with other families in a more relaxed, natural way which helps to build supportive, positive communities.  We have useful information about starting a baby and toddler group. Support and advice for parents As a parent you are your child’s first and most important educator. Research shows that parental support for children’s learning has a direct impact on how well they do, both in early years settings and also later on in life, and it is widely recognised that the learning that takes place in childcare settings builds upon vital home experiences with parents. Information and advice The Alliance actively promotes and supports parental involvement in all our work. We offer impartial information and advice to help you find out more about care and education for young children, so you can make an informed decision about the childcare that is right for your child. We also support parents and children by offering affordable childcare provision, discounted books and resources, family learning programmes and adult training.

        "Description": "Early Years and Childcare Support is committed to working in partnership with all Early Years providers, Early Years Locality Teams and professionals to achieve the highest standards of inclusive, quality early years provision for children and families. Early Years and Childcare Support seeks to provide a range of activities and services by working with all early years providers and the county’s network of Children’s Centres, which aim to improve parent and child attachment, child development, school readiness and the prevention of escalation to specialist services. The government’s Early Help offer recognises that preventing problems or interventions as soon as they are identified is essential to support the development and achievement of children. Well targeted early intervention is likely to lead to better outcomes or improve a child’s resilience against poor outcomes. It is therefore critical that all Early Years providers across Lincolnshire are supported and challenged  to provide outstanding  inclusive, quality provision  for Lincolnshire’s youngest children in order that they all achieve ‘good’ outcomes at the end of the Early Years Foundation Stage and have the necessary skills to enable them to achieve their potential throughout school and their adult life.  Early Years and Childcare Support work in partnership with the Early Years Locality teams to provide the following services that contribute to the Early Help offer;  Promoting and supporting the early identification of children aged 0-5 years with additional needs and disabilities in order to improve outcomes. This is implemented by Early Years Specialist Teachers working closely with SENCos to ensure early identification and intervention for children and their families. Monitoring to ensure that effective early intervention and support for children and their families is provided in a timely manner. Support is given to settings to identify developmental delay in young children and provide additional support in a Children’s Centre or an early years setting to help children catch up with their peers. Providing support and advice to promote school readiness and a smooth transition into school, seeking to ensure that all children are ‘school ready’ and in a position to learn and achieve in a school setting. The key focus of the work is on the delivery of early intervention and transition groups to promote school readiness.

Our support is focused on those on low incomes with a child/children who have a high level of additional support needs. At Family Fund, we believe that all families raising disabled or seriously ill children and young people should have the same choices, quality of life, opportunities and aspirations as other families. We support this by providing grants for a range of essential items. Families can apply for kitchen appliances such as fridges, freezers and cookers, as well as clothing, bedding, games, books and music, laptops and tablets, family breaks, sensory toys and more.   Who can apply? We use our own Child and Young Person’s Eligibility Criteria to assess a disabled or seriously ill child or young person’s additional support needs based on the social model of disability.

We set high expectations, but also provide just the right measure of help and support to get our children to reach their goals in a way where they can be proud of their accomplishments. When the Ofsted team visited us in June 2013, they once again confirmed that Fosse Way is a good school with many outstanding features.  We value the contribution that each child makes and challenge each child to reach their potential.  Disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs, including those taught in the speech and language class, make progress similar to their peers.  The extra support they receive is carefully targeted to meet their individual needs.  The teaching of disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs systematically builds on their previous knowledge and skills.

        "Description": "School vision and values Gainsborough Nursery School will continue to be a centre of excellence for early years’ education. We strive to create an oasis for the children who attend our School, we are their advocates. Moral purpose: We put children and their families at the core of everything that we do, always making decisions that are based upon what is best for the children. We recognise the important yet sometimes challenging role that parents have in bringing up and educating their children. We listen carefully and try to respond to the needs of our families supporting them in educating and cherishing their child. Pedagogy Our curriculum is based upon a high scope philosophy of learning. This curriculum approach has active learning at the very core, it is skills based. Children are guided to explore, interact and exercise their creative imagination through purposeful play. The plan, do, review cycle allows children to consolidate and share learning, the predictable routine and its repetitive nature allows children to develop secure knowledge and understanding, making links and pathways. Children are given ownership of their learning. We use key elements of the high scope pedagogy to deliver our curriculum. We aim to work with families, supporting them in educating and cherishing their child. We are an Outstanding Nursery school (Ofsted 2017). Within our school we have 64 morning spaces and 64 afternoon spaces - 24 of which are in our 2 year class (funded). Children of 3-4 are entitled to 15 hours of free nursery education and some families will be eligible for 30 hours of funded nursery education. These hours can be either taken over 5 mornings, 4 afternoon or full days. We also offer a breakfast session. We welcome children of all abilities within our school.       The school has met the standard for SFVS; Schools Financial Value Standard. Laura Cook is the Headteacher of our Nursery School. Jenny Fullerton is the school SENDCo (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities coordinator). All staff have attended/do attend training to enhance their practice and to become familiar with new research and guidance. This includes the Level 3 ELKLAN award - Speech and Language Support for the Under 5's. The nursery school ensure that we are approachable to all parents and carers. There is time for parents to speak informally to staff at the beginning and end of sessions about any issues they have or information they would like to share with us. We have termly meetings with parents to discuss their child's development and learning in the nursery school. Outside of these times parents can arrange more formal meetings with the staff if they need to discuss something in more detail.  If parents have concerns about their child's learning and development we would encourage them to firstly speak with their child's class teacher to try to work together to support them. If it is felt that additional support is needed above and beyond our quality first teaching then Jenny Fullerton, the SENDCo will be able to offer support and put in extra plans with your child's teacher and yourself. These extra plans may include 1:1 or small group work. If it is felt that we need extra advice beyond the school's expertise then we are able to contact outside agencies to support us. Jenny is able to make referrals to the Community Paediatricians and the Speech and Language Therapy Service. We sometimes work with Occupational Therapists, CAMHS, Physiotherapists and Specialist Nurse Trainers. As recommended by the local authority's special need team, a graduated approach will always be applied when supporting a child with additional needs. If it becomes apparent that after a series of support plans a child requires further specialised support, an application for an Education, Health and Care plan can be made.",

        "Description": "Grantham Preparatory International School is a non-denominational, independent day school for boys and girls between the ages of three and eleven, dedicated to the unimpeded pursuit of academic, musical and sporting excellence. We are conveniently located on the outskirts of Grantham, near the A1. We are a member of International Education Systems – “IES”, with sister schools in Sidmouth, Devon; Cape Town, South Africa; Boca Ratan, Florida; Lisbon, Portugal; Panama City, Panama; Udine, Italy. The outstanding academic reputation and record of the school is based on the maintenance of traditional teaching methods nurtured by the devotion of our highly skilled and experienced teaching Staff. Our aim is to provide the best for all our children. We expect them to work hard to achieve as much as is within their reach; and then a little harder to achieve that which at first seemed unattainable. The happy, family environment, which we have deliberately created, enables us to encourage each individual child to reach his or her full potential in all aspects of our school life. Our rules and guidelines, designed to promote harmony and consideration for others, give our children a feeling of comfort and security, conditions in which they are more readily stimulated. Grantham Preparatory International School is geared to providing specialised tuition for all abilities and our strict limitation on the size of classes underpins this principle; all children, the gifted, average, dyslexic and the less able, receive individual attention. The children are prepared for Public School entrance examinations and for Grammar School selection examinations. Suitable pupils will be guided towards scholarships and given the opportunity to add their names to the lengthening list of our boys and girls who have already attained impressive scholastic awards. The education we offer is well-rounded and the school day is structured to meet all the needs of a child. Our days end with the emphasis on enjoyment. We like to send the children home happy. From 3.15pm to 4.00pm on most days, they are invited to choose from an extensive menu of extra-curricular societies and clubs. Up to fifteen different activities are organised and supervised every week at no extra cost to parents beyond that of raw materials which might be required. Within the framework of these activities, children can stretch their muscles, learn new skills and meet new challenges of their own choosing. Please see www.iesedu.com for further details about this independent international educational institution. We are members of the Independent Schools Association (ISA) and also members of the International Schools Association. The school was opened on its current site in October 1986 and in the academic year 2011/2012 celebrated its silver anniversary.",

        "Name": "Hartsholme Pre-school and Kids Club",
        "Description": "The Nursery Environment   What we have to offer your child Your child will have a busy time at Nursery with a host of stimulating activities to enjoy. Each session will operate within a framework of routine to help your child to feel comfortable and secure in their activities. The daily structure will also ensure that your child is exposed to a balanced curriculum. There will be a varied mix of free play group activities or staff led activities both in and out of doors. As your child gets older they will be guided through a slightly more structured learning programme that will equip them with skills that will enable them to start school with confidence.   Staff The staff at Hartsholme Pre-School will be selected for their individual talents and experience to form a successful team. The team will report to a full time Nursery Manager who will work closely with the Proprietor and area manager to maintain our high standards.   Key Person system Each member of staff will work with a specific age range. Within that age range staff will work more closely with a group of individual children.  The Keyperson system will encourage your child to develop a closer relationship to a specific person at nursery which can be reassuring especially in the early days. The key person will meet and help to settle your child at the beginning of each session and give feedback at the end of the session.   Where to find out what you need to know! There are two entrances to the nursery. One for the under 3’s and the second is for older children. The entrance lobby is a busy zone.  You will find all sorts of information here! Keep an eye on the parent notice board for updated information, weekly menu, fundraising events and Press cuttings etc. A dedicated member of staff will “Meet & Greet” all of the children.    For many of you it will be a race against time to drop off your child and continue on your way to work. Once your child has settled in with us it is likely that they will separate from you happily – but some children will always find it difficult to say goodbye. Please be reassured that we will telephone you to let you know that they have settled – or will be happy to take your call.   The Toddler Room Off the entrance lobby, this room acts as a base for the younger children. This is a space that the children can access resources that are more age appropriate for their stage of development. They can set something up and return to it at a later date without it being interfered with or pose a risk to the younger children.   There will be room for large scale items and also small world play, children will have free access to toys which will be at an appropriate level for them to self select. The children will be encouraged to tidy away the toys they have played with after they have finished.   The Pre-school room At the base of the school is our 3-4 year old room, it is a bright airy room with plenty of activity areas and fantastic outdoor space which is shared with the school nursery provision. There is also a dedicated cosy area so those children can have a well-earned rest. The Home Corner, reflects the current theme, be it a Doctor’s surgery, a shop, or a castle whichever takes the children’s interests. A music system will be available to reinforce other activities such as music and dance / movement.   There will be room for large scale floor play such as Construction, Duplo, or Miniature World play such as the Farm, Jungle world, Cars, Animal Hospital, or the Family Doll’s House. The room will also have the flexibility to host group activities such as singing, dancing and physical activities.   How we organize our day Upon arrival in the morning the children will be offered breakfast and a drink. The children are then guided into small groups according to their age and the ratio of staff to children. The ratios are; 1:3 for under 2 yrs, 1:4 for 2-3 yrs and 1:8 for 3+ yrs.      The children will then move around the different areas of the rooms and participate in the various activities in each area.        Wet and Messy Play / Creative area. This area will host the painting, water, sand, soil and clay play! In fact - anything wet or messy! A structured activity will always reflect the monthly theme. Aprons will be provided, however please do not send them in their best clothes.   Table-top areas When not used for dining, the area will be used for table-top activities. Weighing, measuring, small construction, snipping and sticking, playdoh and a host of other activities. Small group activities such as table-top games will be a regular sessional feature as well as puzzles, colouring and board games.   During each session a group of children will be involved in doing a food preparation activity. This may take the form of weighing out pasta, making cakes or biscuits, or simply counting out fruit segments.   Mealtimes We aim to make mealtimes a comfortable and social occasion when all the children can join together and enjoy their meal in a relaxed, yet disciplined manner. We encourage good table manners and the correct use of cutlery.   Meals for the children will be brought in for the children to enjoy healthy meals. Our aim is to provide food cooked from fresh, healthy ingredients. We follow a healthy eating plan and have our 5 a day fruit & veg plan in operation!   Food Allergies Due to the alarming increase of severe allergies in children today, it is nursery policy not to have any nut products on the premises. Other allergies will be discussed with parents and a suitable course of action will be implemented. Similarly, special dietary requirements such as vegetarian or cultural / religious restrictions will be catered for. If your child has been prescribed with an epipen / anapen please ensure one is on site at all times.     The Nursery Garden The outdoor area of the pre-school is split between the 2-3 area and 3-5 area, we also have access to use the school playing fields which is large and spacious and varied. The children will have their own vegetable garden, the produce of which will be used in the kitchen for their meals. The children will be involved with planting seeds, watering, weeding and harvesting from their garden.   We have various secretive seated areas around the garden for quiet and reflective moments. In fine weather the children will be outside as much as possible, even for a picnic tea! This area is shared with the School nursery so attachments can be building with the older age group from the start.   Outdoor Play The Ride-on-toy patio has a selection of trikes and vehicles. Other patio areas enable year round outdoor activities such as a chalk board, sand and water play.   All children will have the opportunity for outdoor free play and a structured outdoor activity during each session. We aim to encourage your child to accomplish a host of physical skills using their body and small apparatus.    Learning through structured play Whilst we endeavour to provide a learning orientated environment that will encourage participation in activities, I would like to stress that there is unlimited learning potential in structured play.   Whilst some children may enjoy from an early age a more formal approach like sitting quietly at a table some children do not. If this is the case, then we shall look for other ways to engage participation and to achieve the desired outcome. This may take the form of an outdoor activity or a more manipulative activity.   For example your child may be happier to write their letters in the sand with a stick than in a book with a pencil. If at the end of the activity they have learnt how to form and to recognise their letters then we have made progress. Your child’s happiness is paramount. If a child is happy then they will learn.   Planning our activities At the beginning of every month you will receive your invoice and a Newsletter. The Newsletter will inform you of the Themes for the coming weeks. If you are able to enhance any of our themes in any way – by bringing items into nursery, suggesting a relevant speaker or demonstration then we will be pleased to hear from you!   Themes will usually span a “half term” ie 6/7 weeks and will usually reflect the seasons, festivals and celebrations of the calendar as well as be initiated by the interests of the children. We follow an approach of Consulting With Children in our planning using Talking Tubs as a starting point. We follow the starting points of “Diversity” “Our Green World” and “A celebration of ME!” and then follow on from the children’s interests.   Getting the most from the Nursery experience By reinforcing activities at home, talking to your child about what they have done and are going to do, and bringing in items to show the other children, you will be greatly enhancing the learning potential of each nursery session.   When your child starts at nursery they will have an Individual Child Profile on Tapestry. All children will have observations added regularly. The observation will usually include photos of your child and might demonstrate a new skill, or perhaps an activity which your child particularly enjoyed. Please feel free to add photos and activities that you have been up to at home that you would like to share with us at nursery.   Government Funding for Two, Three and Four Year Olds The term following your child’s third birthday they will become eligible to receive funding towards their nursery education. In line with the National Curriculum, Hartsholme Pre-School will be following the guidelines for the Early Years Foundation stage. Some children aged from two years may also be eligible, please ask for more information.   The three primary areas of development are; Personal, Social and Emotional Development, Communication & Language and Physical Development. Four other specific areas of learning and development are considered and incorporated into nursery life. These are; Literacy, Mathematics, Understanding the world and Expressive arts and design.   Your child will be given the opportunity to develop the necessary skills that will aid a smooth transition into education. There will be activities which will specifically develop skills in listening, observation and memory.  There will also be a focus upon social interaction and personal independence.   The Child’s tapestry account will build into an interesting record of the time your child spends with us. If your child cannot communicate coherently to you about their day …we can!  I hope that you will agree that we promise to offer an excellent Day Care facility that your family and your child will enjoy and reap the benefits from!     I look forward to hearing from you soon!",

My setting is called Hippo Hollow Childcare Corner, Conveniently located on Monks Road near the hospital and Prison - on a main bus route and only a 15 minute walk into the town centre.   Why choose Hippo Hollow? I am an experienced, dedicated and trusted Child Care provider with 14 years service, offering a nurturing, home from home, environment where your child's happiness and safety are the top priority, from caring for babies to supporting school children before and after the school day and in school holidays I keep parents informed about their children's daily activities, milestones and any other important updates. I have an established reputation based on trust and relationships with the families I have helped. I provide a supportive network for families who may not have extended family to support them and I go above and beyond for my customers. I offer a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making parents feel instantly calmed and confident in my friendly and nurturing personality being the right person to look after their precious bundle.   I try to accommodate various work schedules if I possibly can. It's sometimes a bit of a jigsaw to fit people in around others and still stay within my permitted ratio of children permitted. I do recognise that no one works 9 - 5 anymore and shift patterns can be a tricky one to deal with but im always happy to try. Being a city based childcare setting means I dont have the large outdoor space a rural or suburban house may have, but every inch of our outdoor space has been maximised to provide a safe and versatile area for different play situations. This space is not just a garden, it's a blank canvas for providing an area for exploring and learning from growing flowers and plants to wildlife friendly elements and interchangeable activities that can be brought out or packed away depending on children's choices and curiosity. In addition we have 2 parks in close proximity where there are wildlife to see, ducks to feed and conkers to collect as well as safe space to run and play and enjoy the outdoors safely away from the limits of roads and traffic. My Last Ofsted Inspection was in February 2020 and I was again awarded GOOD in all areas. I am currently the only REGISTERED childminder available to serve Monks Abbey Primary school and provide a flexible before and after school service and pick up and drop off from Monks Abbey Primary School on Monks Road.

At Holbeach St Marks Primary we look extremely carefully at the progress each individual child makes and this is reviewed regularly. Our school has four core values which reflect our daily practice. These are koinonia (working together), respect, perseverance and wisdom. Our values underpin all we do as a school to develop the whole child. Collective worship takes place daily for all children. This gives time for reflection and brings the school together as a community.  Class teachers plan lessons which are carefully differentiated to ensure each child can learn and make progress across the curriculum. Class sizes here are extremely small, with our largest class currently consisting of 15 children. Teacher knowledge of each and every child is thorough and in depth which secures maximum progress for individuals. Pupil premium is also used to ensure the very best outcomes for all pupils. Phonics is taught in small groups through Letters and Sounds. Children are assessed regularly to ensure they build systematically on previous knowledge whilst developing new skills. At Holbeach St Marks Primary we are excited about our new curriculum. We believe children should experience the world first hand as much as possible and consequently plan a variety of experiences for our children including trips out of school as well as inviting visitors into school. PE is important to us and we offer after school sports clubs for children. We also employ specialist sports coaches to work with both pupils as well as teachers to ensure the delivery of high quality PE. Our children compete against others in our federation schools as well as against other local schools. At Holbeach St Marks Primary we also offer a pre-school education on site. Children may attend the pre-school from the term before they are three. Transition into the Reception Year is highly effective for the pre-school children as they are already comfortable with the adults and the school site. The pre-school has also facilitated early identification of any issues for children which can then be addressed quickly.We actively seek to work closely with all families and operate an open door policy here at Holbeach St Marks. Parents are encouraged to come into school to share concerns or worries. We believe the pupil voice is vital in securing good outcomes for children. The pupil voice is always sought when reviewing progress and targets. We also have a school council elected by the children to represent their views.",

We aim to identify any child with additional needs early so appropriate provision can be planned and delivered and the Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special educational Needs is followed. By working with parents and outside agencies with which the school works closely with, we aim to ensure all pupils have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. The school has established links with:Specialist Teacher and Educational Psychology ServiceSpeech and Language Therapy ServiceLincoln Grief and Loss Service Working together helps us to effectively meet the needs of our pupils. Once support and intervention is planned, this can either take place in the classroom or small groups or individuals may be withdrawn for additional support from a member of the Support Team who are all experienced in supporting the pupils in our school and delivering support and intervention. We use a wide range of strategies and programmes, tailored to best meet the needs of the group or individual. The Village kids club operates a Breakfast and After School Club on site. Our curriculum provides exciting and inspiring learning activities. We used the National Curriculum as our statutory guidance but build on the local environment, provide real life learning opportunities and have a strong scientific focus across out topics. We use the expertise of the staff to deliver specialist lessons where possible and use trips, visits and visitors to stimulate the children's interest and understanding. Instrumental tuition is provided by peripatetic teachers and our Choir can be found performing regularly.

Parents are kept fully informed about the progress their children are making.The Headteacher, staff and Governors believe that extra curricular activities are important and our school provides a range of clubs in sports, music, drama and the arts. This year we have four foundation classes, one for nursery children and three for reception, along with three classes in both year 1 and 2.  In key stage 2 we have eleven classes including three classes in each year group, except year 5 where there are two. However, for literacy and numeracy in the mornings Year 5 are split into 3 teaching groups. The children are taught in sets for numeracy in year 2 and Key Stage 2 and for literacy in years 5 and 6. The majority of our children take the 11+ and transfer to either Horncastle Grammar School or Horncastle Banovallum School. Our OFSTED inspection in January 2009 judged the school to be outstanding providing children with an excellent education, enabling them to reach very high standards. This was due to consistently good and often outstanding teaching. Children were described as having excellent attitudes to their learning and outstanding personal development. The leadership team was described as having a very positive impact on provision, and the head teacher as providing outstanding leadership. Our School Education Adviser's Annual Report also confirms the above. Pupils achieve well with a significant majority making good and better progress, when compared to pupils nationally. This includes all ability children including those with Special Educational Needs. There are no significant differences in achievement between different groups of pupils. The behaviour of our children is very good which is attributed to the quality of the staff. We provide numerous extra curricular activities in music, drama, sport and art and are very successful in local and county competitions.

        "Description": "Welcome to Kids Corner Day Nursery Contact Laura on 01526 321388 Kids Corner Day Nursery provides high quality childcare for children aged from six weeks through to eleven years old. Learning for children is a rewarding and enjoyable experience in which they explore, investigate, discover, create, practise, rehearse and consolidate. If there is a stimulating environment, young children’s learning will be enhanced. Since the change in ownership in April 2013, Kids Corner Day Nursery has been undergoing a much needed refurbishment. We aim to provide the home from home environment, which Ofsted are now looking for. Our aim is to ensure each child can thrive and develop, be content in their surroundings, be stimulated and of course enjoy their days here. Our outside area offers a wide range of physical activities for the children including trike, scooters, push along toys, sand and water trays and so much more. We encourage the children to explore the environment by digging in the soil, searching for bugs and would also like to create a bug den. We have a planting area where the children have been encouraged to plant things and nurture them to see them grow. We have grown tomatoes, potatoes, sunflowers, lettuce, broad beans, spinach, rocket, rhubarb and so much more. We at Kids corner believe children should go outside every day come rain or shine, and therefore we ask parents to provide a spare set of clothes for their child in case they need changing during the day. During spells of good weather we like to take the children out for walks to the park or the local duck pond to enhance their learning further. Planning All the activities that are done with the children are carefully planned and reviewed daily to suit each child’s learning development and mirror their interests. The staff observe the children, noting their development and interests, so that they can plan to extend their knowledge, skills, attitudes and understanding.   Admissions Policy Kids Corner Day Nursery operates a Waiting list. Priority will be given to children     requiring full time care or are eligible to receive nursery funding or who have siblings   already in attendance at Kids Corner Day Nursery. Illness When your child is ill, please let us know as soon as possible, especially if the illness is contagious, like measles or chickenpox. If your child has vomiting or diarrhoea, they must be kept at home for 48 hours after the last bout before they return. This is to try and avoid the infection spreading throughout the whole nursery. If a child has been prescribed antibiotics they must remain at home for the first 24 hours. If your child falls ill or has an accident while here and if it is considered that hospital treatment is necessary but we are unable to contact you, the nursery will act in the best interests of the child and contact the emergency services immediately. Your Child will be cared for in one of our three age related play rooms: Babies Baby Room caters for children from six weeks to 2 year (or when confident with their mobility and starting to communicate clearly) in this room we feel the children learn best through sensory experiences. With this in mind children are given the opportunity to play in things such as jelly, baked beans, corn flour and many more. We are happy to adopt the routines you have put in place for your little one. Resources and activities are selected to encourage each child to experience every aspect of sensory development. Through the use of treasure baskets, babies are able to explore a range of natural and everyday objects, which vary in weight, size, texture, colour, smell and temperature. Activities are based around the three specific areas of learning from the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum. These are known as the prime areas (Physical Development, Communication and Language and Personal, Social and Emotional Development). Toddler room The Toddler Room caters for children from the age of 2 to 3 years. Children of this age group begin to show increasing independence in moving, communicating, learning through play and forming relationships with their peers. Activities and resources are selected to allow each child to develop and promote these skills. Activities are also based around the three specific areas of learning from the Early Years foundation Stage curriculum. Pre-school Room The Pre-school Room caters for children from the age of 3 to school. Children who begin their education in a learning environment that is purposeful, challenging and supportive stand the best chance of developing into confident and successful learners and we are committed to providing such an environment. Activities are based around the seven areas of learning, these will be planned, implemented and records of the observations made will be recorded in the children’s Learning Journeys which will be available for your perusal. They focus on the specific areas which include:  Literacy   Mathematics   Understanding the world   Expressive arts and design  In order for the children to develop in these areas of learning they will have achieved and developed in the prime areas (physical Development, Communication and Language and Personal, Social and Emotional development). Nursery Funding 15 hours Funded Childcare When your child is eligible for Pre- School we will deliver the Foundation Stage to your child and free nursery education sessions will be available for all eligible three and four year olds. These sessions are available at set times of 09.00am to 12.00pm and 12.00pm to 3.00pm each day. Each child can access five sessions per week, and up to 2 sessions can be taken in one day. Sessions are available during term-time only, for 38 weeks per academic school year (190 sessions). More hours can be accessed for full time care, and for this the usual daily rate will apply. Three-year olds who meet the eligibility criteria set by the Local Education Authority and who are born between 1st April and 31st August will be eligible for a free place at the start of the autumn term following their third birthday, those born between 1st September and 31st December will be eligible at the start of the spring term following their third birthday and those born between 1st January and 31st March will be eligible at the start of the summer term following their third birthday. (Please note: if your child takes up two sessions within one day i.e. 9-3pm an additional cost of £1.50 will be incurred for their lunch and snacks) 30 hours Funded Childcare  Please visit childcarechoices.gov.uk to apply for this funding. Parents must reapply for the funding every 3 months and if you are successful then you will be given a code which you will need to give to us to validate for that 3 month period. Without the funding code you will not be able to access the funded sessions. HMRC will email you when you need to reapply for funding. The 30 hours is based over 38 weeks of the year i.e. term time only, However as a setting we do not allow term time only contracts due to staffing contracts etc, so you’re your bill would be annualised for yourselves therefore not noticing the non-funded period. Our sessions for the 30 hours are as follows: Monday-Friday 7.30-12.30pm 12.30-5.30pm You can take the full 10 hour session if you wish. Meals and snacks will be billed to you at a cost of £1.50 per session, therefore if you choose to take two sessions in one day (10 hours) you will incur a cost of £3 per day for all meals and snacks provided, unfortunately due to health and safety regulations you will not be able to provide your own meals. Key Persons System In order to provide continuity of care, your child will be allocated a key person. The key person is responsible for each child’s wellbeing and they will ensure that information regarding your child is exchanged with you on a daily basis. They will provide for the emotional needs of your child e.g. to comfort and reassure in moments of upset or distress and ensure that account is taken of the child’s race, culture, religion, language and parental wishes. The key persons are also responsible for observations, record keeping and the monitoring of children’s progress. Records of these are kept in individual files called Learning Journeys, these are available for you to look at whenever you wish and will be handed over to you when your child leaves Kids Corner Day Nursery. Diaries are completed daily for children in the each of the rooms to inform parents of their child’s nappy changes, feed, sleep times and daily events.   The Minimum Staffing Ratios Are:   1:3   children under 2 years 1:4  children aged 2 years 1:8   children aged 3 to 11 years    Meals, Snacks & Drinks   Children attending full day care sessions will be provided with a morning and afternoon snack, a hot meal at lunchtime and a hot or cold afternoon tea. Breakfast will be provided for those children attending full time and morning sessions around 8:00am. All meals are included into the daily fee. Children attending either morning or afternoon sessions will be provided with a snack and either lunch or tea during their session, the cost of which is included in the fees. Drinks of milk and water will be provided for your children to help themselves to throughout the day. Babies will be prompted regularly throughout the day. If your child is being bottle-fed please provide made up bottles (water only), please also provide us with a named container of formula so that bottles can be made up within the nursery when it is necessary to do so. Indoor Foot wear For hygiene / safety reasons and to keep our flooring in a child friendly order we ask that all children who are able to walk, be supplied with named indoor soft shoes which should remain at the nursery in the winter months. Clothing Please send your children in clothes that you don’t mind getting paint, clay and dough on. All clothes should be named to save them getting lost. Please provide weather permitted clothes e.g. hats and sun cream in summer. Wellington boots, coats, hats and gloves in the winter. We go outside in all weather J We do have a supply of nursery clothes to borrow if your child gets wet or paint-covered. Please return them to us as soon as possible after using them, so others can use them too. Sickness and Medication Policy This is a \"well-child” care facility. If your child becomes unwell during their session  you will be contacted and asked to collect them. To keep other children and our staff free from infectious diseases we enforce an exclusion list. Parents/carers are asked to adhere to our sickness policy, which is provided when sessions have been offered. Parking of Vehicles Parents and carers are asked to park their vehicles in the designated parking area only. When we were granted planning permission for the nursery, North Kesteven District Council stipulated that NO vehicle is to park on the main road outside the nursery. If this policy is abused we will be given up to three warnings and then given a conveyance notice to vacate the premises within 6 months. Please help us to keep our nursery and your children safe! Please control your child during pick up times. Do not allow your child to run out to your car while you are still inside. The safety rule is that “no one goes outside without their parents accompanying them”. There is to be no parking on the grass verge outside the nursery for dropping off or collections.

        "Description": "King Edward VI, in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, opened as an academy in the autumn of 2012. The academy will be a world-class academy, with every member of our learning community feeling part of something very special and having the opportunity to discover and achieve their potential. This is why we have selected ‘broadening horizons’ as our mission statement. Every student has unique skills. Our personalised curriculum and innovative program of co-curricular activities means we will support the development of well-rounded and confident individuals who will be a credit to themselves and their community. The academy has achieved the Autism Inclusion Mark and Food for Life Silver Award. We have a dynamic Global Dimension agenda and have received the International Schools award from the British Council.We are a bilateral academy – that is, a secondary school with a grammar stream in each year of entry. We have a strong House system as do all schools in the David Ross Education Trust’s network. Prior to opening, we underwent a wide-ranging refurbishment, with new sports facilities, landscaped gardens and a new learning centre.Students are organised into groups of similar ability, taking into account their 11+ results and recommendations received from primary headteachers. This means our most able students achieve the highest academic standards in the best grammar school tradition. The academy caters for all abilities and offers a full range of curriculum opportunities in modern, purpose-built facilities, enjoying the latest technologies. Our students are known as individuals and their needs are met in full, whether they are academic, vocational, artistic or sporting. The academy also enjoys a sports hall facility, which is shared with our neighbours the Lady Jane Franklin School. We very much welcome parents of incoming students to the academy and would be delighted to give you the opportunity to see what we have to offer your child. The academy was inspected during May 2014 and the inspectors commended the progress that staff and the academy’s sponsor, the David Ross Education Trust, are making on the academic and cultural development of students, and the impact that this is having on raising aspirations and achievement. The inspectors graded the school “Good” across the board, particularly noting that: The proportion attaining five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and mathematics, places the academy in the top 40% of all schools in the country; Teaching across the school is “consistently good, with some outstanding” practice; Inspectors reported that \"Individual and highly personalised support ensures that disabled students and those who have special educational needs receive the help they need to achieve well.\" and that \"Good support from teaching assistants to improve reading builds students' confidence and self-esteem,and prepares them well for learning later in the academy\". Students express great pride in being a part of the academy. The strong house system adds to their feeling of ‘being a part of a community’ and sense of ‘belonging’; The Principal’s good leadership is focusing all staff on raising achievement throughout the academy. This is raising students’ aspirations and ambitions; Students’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is strengthened through the exceptional and extensive selection of additional activities offered since becoming a part of the trust; Aspirations have risen through contact with high profile, high achieving sports personalities, politicians and successful business people. To support this, King Edward VI Academy is currently having a sixth form centre built on site, the science labs are being refurbished and new teacher development programmes are being offered through the trust. Wendy Marshall, Chief Executive of the David Ross Education Trust, said: “Staff and students at the school should be rightly proud of the progress that they have made. “The one thing that I am particularly delighted about is that Ofsted inspectors’ recognised the impact that all the hard work and dedication is having on the young people themselves. “Not only are results improving, but more students are going on to bigger and better things. Ensuring that we can enable students to fulfil their own potential and aspirations are at the heart of everything the Trust stands for.”",

        "Description": "The pupils experience a rich and varied educational experience through the curriculum and in extra-curricular activities because all provision is suitable adjusted to meet individual needs.  Each pupil is given the opportunity to feel confident, involved and valued. Our ethos is that ‘the individual counts’ and this is reflected in every aspect of school life. We accept pupils of all abilities in both Junior and Senior school and our emphasis is placed on providing each with an opportunity to fulfil their potential both academically and in terms of personal development.  To this end, our curriculum is wide and varied and pupil and parental choices are always considered. For example, pupils entering Senior School have the option to take two modern foreign languages, only one or they may choose to use this timetabled time for extra support in English. We fully appreciate that each child is different and that they learn in different ways; at different rates and that their social skills and confidence may vary. The school accepts pupils of all abilities and therefore learning is always tailored to meet the needs of the individual. This unique approach together with small class sizes enables all pupils to achieve their full potential. Our Value Added score shows that pupils exceed expectations and that their progress is significant. Pupils who are particularly able in a subject such as Maths, English or Music may be fast tracked and then encouraged to take on further study at a higher level and the school has a well managed and challenging Gifted and Talented programme. We are totally inclusive and careful setting enables us to provide for our most able pupils. For pupils who require extra support, our Learning Support Department provides both in class support and one to one tuition. Each pupil’s needs are considered carefully; we are not a ‘one size fits all’ school! We adopt a ‘whole child ‘approach at all times and our nurturing environment and small size means that all pupils are known personally. They are actively encouraged to take on positions of responsibility and to engage fully in the wider aspects of school life such as in sport, music, drama, the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, National Sports Leaders and the National Arts Award. Our primary concern is that our pupils leave us with high self esteem, confidence, awareness and consideration for others and the best academic results they can achieve. All pupils benefit from an education which is tailored to meet individual needs. Pupils follow a broad and balanced curriculum, but within this there is a great amount of parental and pupil choice. Pupils can choose, for example, to study two Modern Foreign Languages in Year 7, one only or they may have this curriculum time to focus on English and Mathematics. As they progress through to Key Stage 4 study, they have a great deal of choice regarding numbers of subjects studied and at which level. We offer both GCSEs and BTECs.

It is our aim that the children and adults of Lacey Gardens School achieve their full potential and become confident, secure, caring individuals. At Lacey Gardens, we are very proud of our school which is set in attractive and extensive grounds with great facilities for a range of outdoor learning. We offer a stimulating learning environment and a friendly, dedicated team of staff. Inside the main building, we have a hall, twelve classrooms, a large Art Studio, a fully equipped ICT suite and a central library area.  In addition to this we have our own kitchen serving high quality, nutritious meals.   The school is set in attractive grounds and has a hard surface playground and extensive playing fields. At the bottom playground there is a wonderful amphitheatre with seatng for children. The learning opportunities we provide are of the highest quality. Every pupil is encouraged to do their best in all areas of school life. We aim to support pupils as they learn by giving them a strong sense of belonging, building self esteem and developing a passion for learning and the confidence to try new things so that we allow each child to flourish and truly achieve their potential. Our recent Ofsted Inspection has rated us as a Good School (with the report rating aspects of the school as outstanding!). Within each year group there are currently three classes. We follow the International Primary curriculum (IPC) This has been created by a group of leading experts in children’s learning and aims to prepare children for the fast-changing world they will face in the future. It is designed to ensure children of all working styles flourish and encourages co-operative group learning as well as individual learning. Our curriculum is delivered via stimulating topics - some examples of our popular themes are Chocolate, Footprints from the Past, Mission to Mars and  Fairgrounds. The school has been successful in achieving the following awards - Active Mark- Healthy Schools Award- Quality Mark- International School Award Lacey Gardens School upholds children’s right to education and recognise the diverse educational needs within its community. We acknowledge those needs may change and require a range of provision. We believe we have a duty to offer that provision where we can, to foster inclusion and provide full educational access. Some children need increased support to access learning because: a. they have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of the same age; b. they have a disability which affects their ability to access and benefit from the educational opportunities generally enjoyed by children of the same age. We endeavor to ensure that all barriers to equal access in our school are removed or overcome.  We monitor and track progress of all children so that the support provided is as effective as possible.  We seek the full engagement of parents and carers and where necessary gain support and advice from specialists outside school to ensure we develop and maintain a range of flexible resources to meet the needs of all our children.",

There is also a lunchtime lounge where children are able to build up their social skills through play. The children supported by the midday supervisors are identified on an Emotionally Aware board in the staff room where children with specific emotional needs have their photographs on a small display with information on the back which outlines trigger points and ways of calming the child down.  We believe that it is very important that all adults working within school are aware of the needs of our children.  In addition to our excellent relationships with our children we also pride ourselves on our relationships with parents and carers. Our parents and carers are very supportive and their comments are always taken into account. The staff in our school have an open door policy whereby parents and carers are always able to come and discuss any concerns. We also offer a support group for parents and carers with children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. If you have concerns about your child either socially and emotionally or in terms of their learning, then the class teacher will be more than happy to discuss your worries. We aspire to have motivated, thoughtful, happy children, parents/carers and staff at our school.  We are very pleased that we achieve this aim on a daily basis.",

St Bernard’s School is situated in Louth and is close to many local amenities and learning opportunities within the community.  The academy caters for students aged from 2-19 and serves a wide catchment area, including the east coastal strip.  It serves almost the whole of this rural county and caters for a wide range of additional needs and associated learning difficulties. All students attending the academyhave a statement of additional educational need / Education health and care plan and are placed by the Additional Needs Panel of Lincolnshire County Council Children’s Services.  The only exception is where a child may be accessing an assessment place in the Early Years Department. The academy caters for a wide range of learning difficulties and encompassing associated difficulties, such as autism, communication difficulties, physical disabilities, dyspraxia, profound and multiple disabilities and sensory impairment.  Our mission statement: ‘Learn for life and work for the future through inspiring, purposeful and personalised learning every day'.  The curriculum focuses primarily on addressing the students’ individual barriers to learning, in addition to national curriculum subjects delivered through themes or topics. The learning environments are designed to be low-arousal and much of the teaching is supported visually to enhance the processing of information. The academy has a hydrotherapy pool, a purpose-built D&T room (food technology) and large outside play areas. In order to provide an outstanding education we encourage links with other schools in order to deliver a range of experiences to our young people. this is across both Early years, primary and secondary, as well as with post 16 providers. We are accredited with healthy schools / Eco schools and hold the Aim4Lincs accreditation for the work we carry out with students on the Autistic spectrum.  We utilise TEACCH (treatment and education of autistic and related communication difficulties)  and the SPELL (structure. positivity, empathy, low arousal and links) approach in meeting these needs on a daily basis. We are also accredited through the National Autistic Society for our outreach service. Our approach is highly personalised to each individual's needs, therefore each student has an individual learning programme (ILP), based on their own particular needs and barriers to learning.

We offer a flexible individual approach across the academy and federation, with all of our pupils have access to a topic based approach based on their areas of interest and a range of accreditation including entry levels, Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme as well as a comprehensive work related learning programme.  We also provide a sensory curriculum, where therapies including rebound and hydrotherapy are delivered to support the students learning experiences.Throughout all age ranges we provide pupils with the life skills they will need when they leave us, these skills are appropriate to each individual pupil and can range from using a knife and fork through to road safety. Early Years: The Early Years department follows the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum, which is taught through topics.  Individual targets are taken from the each student’s EHC plan / Statement and incorporated into a play based style of learning.  We are also able to offer an assessment provision with EYFS, in order to support the gathering of information with expertise from staff within the federation and other professionals to support early intervention. KS 4/5: The Upper academy department focuses on promoting independence and communication skills through both accredited schemes and learning experiences both on and off site.

Our setting: I own Little Star Childminding, I have been working as a registered childminder for 20 years. I work alongside my assistant and daughter Katy who has a degree in Early Years and Childhood studies. I live in uphill Lincoln close to the main routes in and out of the city which makes accessibility easy for parents to pick up and drop off children enroute to work/home. There is also a bus stop just a short walk from the setting. Our Ethos:I absolutely love the work that I do, it's not only fun but also extremely rewarding. I think it's the best thing in the world being able to help our special little people grow into even more amazing big people!I believe in providing a stimulating learning space for children to develop and learn. Children's learning and independence is of paramount importance and therefore to enable them to thrive in our setting, their learning is closely linked with their interests.I see being a registered childminder as a role which involves working closely with parents to ensure the best possible care for their child. I believe parents know their children best and try incorporate their practices as much as is possible when caring for their child. Experience:I have had much varied experience in working with children who have special educational needs and I have been lucky enough to be able to welcome numerous families within my years of childcare, which means I have lots of experience of working with many multicultural and multiracial families. All children are embraced and welcomed here and are made to feel loved and cared for. Our Home:Our home has a large lounge used for play, quiet time and homework (for the after school children), the conservatory leading from this which is where we store most of the resources and these are available to the children to access freely, this area leads to the garden with outdoor activities such as sand and water play, ride on toys and other garden resources. Activities and learning:I believe in providing all children with warm, safe,secure and 'homelike' environment. I enjoy doing fun activities which include: story sharing, arts and crafts, musical activities, outdoor play,free play, outings to local parks/places of nature and interest and much, much more!! Our activities are very much child led and I like to follow a child's interests to help them learn! Children in our setting are enabled and encouraged to choose resources and activities and the area in which they choose to play. It is my belief that children in a comfortable, caring and support environment grow and thrive. Early Years Funding:I am happy to be able to offer early years funded childcare for 2,3 and 4 year old children who are eligible, including the 30 hour funding. Please contact me for more information regarding this. I would love to hear from anyone who thinks they would like to become part of our setting!!Thank you!",

He/she may or may not spend one year in the nursery class followed by one year in reception. This phase of education is known as the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and has its’ own curriculum, based on the ‘early learning goals’ and divided into areas of learning. Throughout reception year staff and parents will have consulted together to complete a Foundation Stage Profile of each child’s achievements in learning. Years 1 and 2 (ages 5-7) are known as Key Stage 1 (KS1) and are where the more formal learning begins. The National Curriculum is followed and children’s attainment formally assessed at the end of Year 2 by their teacher, the results of which are reported to parents. From Year 3 to Year 6 children progress through Key Stage 2 (KS2) and continue the National Curriculum, again tested at the end of Y6 through teacher’s assessments and Standard Attainment Tests (SATs). In other year groups children undertake ‘in-house’ SATs towards the end of the academic year to inform teachers of individual children’s progress. The school has a dedicated Nursery for those children whose fourth birthday falls between 1st September - 31 August of the present academic year. The Nursery is well staffed with a fully qualified teacher who's supported by two or three teaching assistants. Family Learning is taking place on Thursday mornings this year.

We have been lucky enough to find our forever home, a lovely 1865 cottage situated in the village of Skellingthorpe. I love our new home and have lots of indoor and outdoor space for the children to play and explore.

I have so far had the pleasure of looking after a range of ages starting from 6 months up to 12 years. Previously I have worked in the sport and leisure industry, where I progressed from being a gym instructor up to managing a private health club. This allowed me to work with both adults and children. I have also worked in America and the UK teaching children to swim. My last place of work was for a private educational company who provide training to teachers. I worked in the school development team, where I worked very closely with the schools CPD coordinator to establish the schools training needs. I recently achieved a Good with outstanding aspects in my latest Ofsted inspection. I am also a member of PACEY Meet the Family Me - Aka Lyndsay – When I’m not working I love to work out.

Almost everything we do involves communication; everyday tasks such as learning at school, asking for food and drink, sorting out problems, making friends and having fun. These all rely on our ability to communicate with each other. Makaton is a language programme using signs and symbols to help people to communicate. It is designed to support spoken language and the signs and symbols are used with speech, in spoken word order. With Makaton, children and adults can communicate straight away using signs and symbols. Many people then drop the signs or symbols naturally at their own pace, as they develop speech. For those who have experienced the frustration of being unable to communicate meaningfully or effectively, Makaton really can help. Makaton takes away that frustration and enables individuals to connect with other people and the world around them. This opens up all kinds of possibilities. Makaton uses signs, symbols and speech to help people communicate. Signs are used, with speech, in spoken word order. This helps provide extra clues about what someone is saying. Using signs can help people who have no speech or whose speech is unclear. Using symbols can help people who have limited speech and those who cannot, or prefer not to sign. Makaton is extremely flexible as it can be personalised to an individual's needs and used at a level suitable for them. It can be used to:  share thoughts, choices and emotions label real objects, pictures, photos and places take part in games and songs listen to, read and tell stories create recipes, menus and shopping lists write letters and messages help people find their way around public buildings  Today over 100,000 children and adults, use Makaton symbols and signs. Most people start using Makaton as children then naturally stop using the signs and symbols as they no longer need them. However, some people will need to use Makaton for their whole lives.",

As a GOOD school with OUTSTANDING elements, in particular Behaviour and Leadership and Management, we pride ourselves on our aspirational and inclusive ethos. Our Local Authority ‘Supported Self-Review’ reported:  The culture of the school is characterised by high expectations and aspirations for all pupils. The school works well with parents, including those who might find working with the school difficult, to achieve positive benefits for pupils. Teaching assistants are well deployed within the classrooms and make a very positive contribution to pupils’ learning and progress. Intervention programmes are clearly planned and linked to specific pupil’s education and social needs. The quality of intervention is at least good and frequently outstanding. Procedures for monitoring and target setting are of exceptionally high quality. Any pupil that feels the need can join in intervention groups if they choose to do so. This is part of the culture of the school and valued by the pupils. Behaviour in intervention groups is excellent.

It has always been our belief that the task of a primary school is to provide the children with a happy and secure environment in which they can attain their full potential. Our aims are:  To provide a good foundation of skills, particularly in English, Mathematics and Science. To enable children to develop their own individuality and means of expression, using a wide range of approaches. To develop self-discipline in a supportive and caring environment and encourage honesty, initiative, self-control and acceptable social behaviour. To provide opportunities for a rich variety of experience, so that children can live a full, active, healthy and useful life within the community as a whole.To build up a genuine enjoyment of both work and play. To open new fields of study and lay the foundation for the pursuit of knowledge. To involve all children in tasks which will give them opportunities to use their initiative in school and in extra-curricular activities. To ensure equal opportunities for both girls and boys.  All maintained schools have a similar approach to meeting the needs of pupils with Special Educational Needs and are supported by the Local Authority to ensure that all pupils, regardless of their specific needs, make the best possible progress in school. All schools are supported to be as inclusive as possible, with the needs of pupils with a Special Educational Need/s being met in a mainstream setting wherever possible, where families want this to happen. For your child this would mean:  That the teacher has the highest possible expectations for your child and all pupils in their class. That all teaching is based on building on what your child already knows, can do and can understand. Different ways of teaching are in place so that your child is fully involved in learning in class. This may involve things like using more practical learning. Specific strategies (which may be suggested by the SENCO or outside staff) are in place to support your child to learn. Your child’s teacher will have carefully checked on your child’s progress and will have decided that your child has gap in their understanding/learning and needs some extra support to help them make the best possible progress.  All children in school should be getting this as a part of excellent classroom practice when needed.",

As part of the federation, we also have a specialist learning mentor providing emotional, social and behavioural support. Marshchapel Primary is an all-inclusive school, where every child really does matter. We firmly believe that regular communication between school and home is vital when additional support or guidance is needed for a specific child; we have an experienced special need coordinator and dedicated members of staff, who will go the extra mile to find the correct journey for each child. Whether that be small group intervention, one to one sessions or a specific scheme of work to support their progress. Our teaching assistants provide invention, within the class setting, and are trained in relevant programs that again support special educational needs. Detailed and regular pupil progress meetings hold teachers to account, and when children are not making the progress expected, questions are asked and an action plan is put into place. We also have links to specialist services and outside agencies and will contact them as and when support and advice is needed. The school will then communicate this to parents/guardians. Although we are very careful about adding children to the special need register, we do identify children at an early age, and begin invention to support their needs. Within the nursery setting, we have specialist speech and language assistant through an Elklan t rained practitioner. Marshchapel is a small school and resources can be limited, but by being a part of the Fenland Federation, we have the expertise and resources across the federation that are readily available.

Our School Vision The school exists to care for the needs of children, and all those in the school should work in their best interests. This means we must constantly create a school and classroom climate that fosters learning and values in which the school feel, and are, safe and secure. The children should recognise and adhere to boundaries and guidelines and understand their purpose. Our lessons and activities should stimulate the children's minds and spark their imagination. They should steadily grow in skills and knowledge and leave us numerate, literate and socially and emotionally well adjusted young people. Where it exists we should overcome disadvantage. Children should achieve their potential in fitness and in sport. When our children have grown and matured we want them to remember their school as a good place, a place that inspired lifetime learning and set them fair for a happy and worthwhile life and career. OFSTED We are proud to be a good school and 100% of parents strongly agree or agree that their child enjoys being at Monks Abbey (2009 Ofsted report). The opening paragraph of the 2009 report states that \"Monks Abbey is a good school that serves its community well. The school's positive ethos offers a warm and welcoming environment so pupils feel safe and valued. It promotes harmonious relations between its diverse social and cultural groups; pupils respect and support each other sensitively and kindly. Those who join from other schools speak favourably about how the school cares for them and helps them to learn. As one pupil said, \"Everyone is different but special, that's why I like it here\"",

At Monks Abbey Primary School Nursery, we offer an ambitious curriculum rich in awe, wonder and memorable experiences. We work collaboratively to provide a stimulating environment that provides exciting opportunities, promotes progression of knowledge and skills, challenge, exploration, adventure and a real love of learning. The Characteristics of Effective Learning for Early Years. underpin everything we do and we strive to ensure these are present in all aspects of our EYFS curriculum. In line with our whole school vision, it is our intent that all children develop physically, verbally, cognitively and emotionally in an environment which values all cultures, communities and people. We aim for our children to be confident and independent, to believe in themselves and interact positively with others. We use the overarching EYFS principles of Unique Child, Enabling Environments, Positive Relationships and Learning and Development when considering provision for our learners in order to ensure that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their starting point, gender, race, religion or background. We understand that play is an integral part of learning and this is at the heart of our EYFS curriculum. We believe a combination of adult directed and uninterrupted child-initiated play ensures the best outcomes for all pupils. Warm and positive relationships between staff and children, consistent routines and strong relationships with parents are key. We recognise the crucial role that early education has to play in providing firm foundations upon which the rest of a child’s education is successfully based.",

It is a spectrum condition, which means that, while all people with autism share certain difficulties, their condition will affect them in different ways. Some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support. People with autism may also experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colours. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism.

We are situated in the mobile classroom on the back playground. At the end of the morning session the children are released to their classrooms at 8.50am. For the after school session the children are collected from the hall at 3.30pm (or come to us when they finish at an after school club) and we close at 5.30pm. There may be an extra £10.00 charge per 15 minutes if children are not collected by 5.30 pm. Persistent lateness will result in the place being withdrawn. When you come to collect your child please phone 213 from the internal phone situated on the wall in the lobby outside the school office. If your child is to go home with anyone who is not on your list you gave us of people authorised to collect your child, you must let us know who they will be going home with. This includes, for instance, if your child is to go home with another child from Child Care Club. A bill will be sent to you in the first week of the month which shows what you owe for your use of the Club for the previous month.",

        "Description": "Visions and Values  OUR SHARED VISION We know that education in our school only takes 4 years but, hopefully, every child will develop a love of learning that lasts a lifetime.   At Nettleham Infant and Nursery School, we aspire to be an example of the best kind of school – one that creates great people. Staff filled with enthusiasm and passion alongside children immersed in a culture of sky-high expectation, relentless learning inside a caring, happy community.   Developing the building blocks for life-long learning is complex. Embedding and applying the knowledge and skills required to be exceptional is very demanding. At Nettleham Infant and Nursery School we know that these things don’t happen by accident but by hard work. We are always striving to build a bigger me.   Our ADULTS are professionally inspired, motivated, morally driven and provided with the conditions under which they are truly incredible. We ensure they are not inundated with unnecessary workload. Our professional capital is only outweighed by our professional happiness.   Our CHILDREN are curious, creative and courageous. They thrive in challenge and soar when they are at the centre of their learning. Simply put, they are amazing every day. No challenge is too big, no problem too difficult; they know what they are doing, why they are doing it and how they can be better. They are partners in the learning process – ALWAYS challenged, engaged and moving forward.  OUR SHARED VALUES At Nettleham Infant and Nursery School we believe that children can achieve their personal best through the teaching and modelling of values and learning attitudes. Our 6 core values – Friendship, Honesty, Respect, Happiness, Kindness and bringing them all together with Community - drive and shape every aspect of school life, and have taken the place of school ‘rules’. We also believe that children need to develop key learning attitudes to help them succeed – Creativity, Resilience and Wellbeing.   Traditionally schools use words to explain values to children but we want to help the children understand the associated feelings and emotions that might arise from the values in a more visual way. In order to make our school values accessible to – and understood by – the children and their families we have created our Values characters.    We use these characters to talk about our values with the children.  Each week we recognise and celebrate children, who demonstrate and promote our values, across the school.    Our values are at the heart of our learning. All the children receive a Little Book of Values to keep and share with their parents and carers.  Find our more about our Values Characters here . . .

        "Description": "New Leake is a very small Primary School with a warm and friendly family atmosphere which was described by Ofsted in their last report as “an outstandingly caring and supportive school” where pupils are “outstandingly well cared for, guided and supported”. At New Leake Primary School we aim to provide a quality education for the whole child in a happy, caring, and well-ordered learning environment; where pupils are valued as individuals and where we are all challenged to maximize our potential. There are currently 53 children on roll who are grouped into 3 classes, each with a caring, supportive and qualified teacher, which means we are able to provide a very favourable adult to child ratio. On our staff team we also have an experienced full time teaching assistant who is also a qualified teacher, as well as other part time teaching assistants, who support children with Special Educational Needs, on an individual and small group basis for targeted intervention.  The Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Co-ordinator (SENDCo) has over 8 years of experience in this role and regularly attends courses to update her knowledge, which she is able to share with other staff members. She works very closely with numerous outside agencies to provide full support for the child and advice for staff and parents. Such agencies include STAPS (Specialist Teaching and Applied Psychology Service); Lincolnshire Social Communication Including Autism Pathfinder Outreach Team (A National Autistic Society (NAS) Accredited Service); Pathways, from Lincolnshire’s Teaching and Learning Centre, School Nursing Team; Teachers from the Sensory Impaired Service, Speech and Language Therapy Team and Parents Support Advisers and Family Support Workers. Class teachers oversee, plan and assess each child’s learning and progress carefully and also meet with the SENDCo regularly during Pupil Progress Meetings to assess pupils’ progress and identify any further targeted support or assessment necessary.  Class teachers meet with parents on a regular basis to discuss their child’s achievements, needs and next steps. The SENDCo is pleased to meet with parents at all parent consultation evenings as well as being available for an appointment to discuss any concerns or queries throughout the year. We aim to offer all children an education tailored to suit them as individuals. Where children need extra support with language or mathematics, individual and /or small group intervention programmes are put in place. We believe in a close partnership with parents/carers of all our pupils but especially with parents with special needs. We can also offer advice to parents/carers on practical ways of helping their child at home. The School has strong links with local secondary schools and pre-schools and believes strongly in the importance of partnership working and ensuring children have a smooth transition to their new school, which is paramount for children with Special Educational Needs. We are an inclusive school and adopt a positive attitude towards all disabled people with all children’s accommodation being on the ground floor where there is also a disabled toilet. Provision is also made for the gifted and talented and generally more able children through the class organisation and all children are encouraged to develop as independent learners. Our school works collaboratively and very closely with Stickney Primary School and also one other local rural Lincolnshire school.  This means that our staff are able to share best practice and work together taking advantage of some of the benefits of belonging to a larger school, whilst retaining our individual identities. Our school curriculum was graded as good in our last Ofsted report and aims to encompass all subject areas and enables us to provide a high standard of teaching and learning.  We have adopted a highly practical and cross-curricular approach and we endeavour to equip our pupils with the skills required to be independent and responsible citizens. The school also runs many extra- curricular activities that the pupils can participate in after school.  We are able to utilise our outdoor facilities, such as our growing area, greenhouse and large field for many of these club activities.  We are proud to have achieved our Bronze Food for Life award. We have also achieved our “Enhanced Healthy School” status and all the staff promote the need for a healthy lifestyle which was also recognised in our last Ofsted report.  The staff also organise a range of visits for our pupils.  The year 6 class enjoy a residential PGL experience and other classes go on day trips to places of interest usually linked to their class topics and our creative curriculum. Pupils with special educational needs generally achieve in line with similar children nationally and make expected progress or better at New Leake Primary. At the end of Year 6 last year 100% of pupils with special needs made expected progress or better in Reading and Writing with over half (67%) making better than expected progress in reading.",

We pride ourselves on the level of care and support we offer and believe we help each child become the best they can be during their time with us. We have achieved the Active Mark and Healthy School status and we are also part of the SCoRE programme with appointed Carbon Ambassadors who have helped us significantly reduce our energy consumption.  The progress of our children with SEN & D compares favourably with those who do not and some children have made exceptional progress during their time in school. We have experience of successfully supporting children by providing Quality First Teaching and a range of interventions, where appropriate, including tailored literacy and numeracy programmes, one to one/paired/small group work, precision teaching and development of social skills and behaviour. We consult with relevant professionals including the Educational Psychologist, the Working Together Team who support children with social and communication difficulties, and health professionals who help us devise personalised plans for the children that need them. Children’s needs are identified early and programmes put into place to help them close the gap with their peers, where needed. In order to ensure this happens, our staff receive regular and relevant professional development so that they can deliver the most effective teaching and support to the children.",

Experience the changing seasons from carpets of snowdrops and daffodils in spring to spectacular rhododendrons in summer and glorious leaf colour in autumn.  The Deer Park: The deer park has been home to herds of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) for around 250 years. You are welcome to walk through the public area of the deer park from January to the end of September, although we ask that you stay out of the deer sanctuary and the fishing lake area. The red deer, the largest land animals to be found wild in Britain, are easily recognisable with their reddish-brown coats. The shyer fallow deer have pale beige coats, spotted with white. In October you can hear the male deer roar and clash antlers when the dominant male tries to keep all others away from his females during the mating period. The males lose their antlers around March, so you can see the new ones developing through until August. The young are born in June and July when the mothers find a quiet spot to give birth. Throughout the summer you will see the youngsters running around the deer park. Please note that there is no public access through the deer park during October, November and December. The Woodland: The woodland contains superb mature beeches, oaks and sweet chestnuts. There are also more unusual species like the Tulip Tree and the Handkerchief Tree. Close to the Hall is a magnificent Evergreen or Holm Oak, Quercus ilex. The tree is a rarity this far north and its lower branches are worn smooth by the generations of children playing on it. You'll also find dozens of species of birds, butterflies and wild flowers in the woodland and in autumn, unusual types of fungi. A path has been installed through the woodland to make the area accessible for wheelchairs and pushchairs.",

Parents are invited to join our whole school celebration assemblies held in the Village Hall.  These include Harvest Festival – school and Kirkby-cum-Osgodby Church service, Christingle (Sunday Service), Leavers and Prize Giving Assembly. Breakfast Club, After School and Holiday Club are provided by the on site Pegasus Childcare Centre. This is independent of the school and charity registered provision. We have good links with the staff, pupils and parents from Pegasus and the majority of the children who attend Pegasus transfer to Osgodby Primary School.

        "Description": "PASIC, or Parent's Association for Seriously Ill Children, was formed in 1977 by parents and a hospital consultant at the Nottingham Children's Hospital, QMC. It was felt there was a need for support and that the best kind of support would come from parents who had shared a similar experience. PASIC has now grown and is currently supporting over 400 families throughout the East Midlands who have been diagnosed or receiving treatment at Nottingham's Childrens Hospital. A large part of that support comes through our social events - organised to bring families together in a relaxed atmosphere where they can catch up with friends that they have made whilst in hospital and make new friends with families whose children have already completed their treatment. PASIC provides help and support to families in the following ways; PASIC Grants PASIC offers financial support in the form of a grant, given to help families with additional costs which come about as a direct result of the child's illness. Help is given to pay bills such as additional heating, increased phone bills, laundry or travel expenses. Considerations is also given to requests for specific items that are deemed necessary due to restrictions caused by a child's illness Social Activities PASIC organise a variety of social occasions, activities and outings for the whole family. Bringing families together in a relaxed environment helps to relieve stress and build important support networks with other families in a similar situation. Organised activities can be key to bringing families together during what can be an extremely difficult period; when siblings of a seriously ill child are often lacking attention. Communication PASIC produces a quarterly newsletter, which helps parents keep in touch with each other and provides focus on the ways that PASIC is able to help, either through the activities on offer or by sharing other parents messages. Support for teenagers PASIC is currently exploring ways of supporting teenage patients with activities specifically aimed at this age group. PASIC relies on the support of its partners in the hospital, the medical staff, the nursing staff and the social work team, to name but a few, if you think you can help we would love to hear from you.",

This team also includes Children's Occupational and Speech and Language Therapy. The team work across the county in a variety of settings with children and young people aged 0-19 years. Specialist Physiotherapists work with children and young people who have physical difficulties which affect the way they move. These difficulties  may relate to problems with  muscles or bones or may be related to injuries to the brain or nervous system. Exercises and advice regarding posture,balance or coordination may be required and  sometimes, in more complex cases, specialist equipment may be given e.g. to enable child/young person  to stand or walk. Children and young people at risk of developing postural problems are identified early through specialist assessment and along with the Children's Occupational Therapists advice and equipment may be advised to prevent complications such as tight tendons and hip/spinal problems happening in the future.. The physiotherapist will also advise on how to safely move and handle children ensuring parents carers and the child/young person are safe. Physiotherapists are also involved with children/young people who have long term respiratory conditions ensuring that the child/young person and carers are equipped to identify potential problems and manage them early in order to prevent having to go into hospital. The aim of the Children's Therapy team  is to help the child/young person reach their full potential through providing  appropriate intervention, advice and support.They do this by carrying out highly specialist assessments to identify the need and, in partnership with the child or young person; parents, schools or nurseries, goals are set and management options agreed upon. Options may be in the form of specific targeted work over a time period or advice and strategies integrated into their daily routine. The therapists do not work with the child or young person indefinitely but aim to empower them and their parents to become the experts in their own care seeking advice from the therapists when necessary. In working very closely with other professionals in health; education and social care such as specialist doctors and surgeons,teachers and carers the therapists can advise on ways to improve on movement.",

PECS was first implemented with pre‐school students diagnosed with Autism at the Delaware Autism Program. The findings from the program were that 76% of children placed on PECS acquired speech as either their sole communication system or augmented by a picture based system. Since then PECS has been implemented worldwide with a variety of learners of all ages who have various cognitive, physical and communication challenges. PECS consist of six phases. It begins by teaching an individual to give a single picture of a desired item to a “communicative partner”, who immediately honours the exchange as a request. The system goes on to teach discrimination of pictures and how to put them together in sentences. In the more advanced phases, individuals are taught to use modifiers, answer questions and comment.  We run approximately 95 PECS workshops per year, plus we also offer training in behaviour management, sexual and social safety for those with additional needs plus the highly acclaimed ‘Language of Emotions’ and more. We also offer consultancy in the form of in-school support, in-home support, in-community support. 1:1 consultation and remote support via interactive technology (skype or sightspeed). Post training we offer support in the form of a very active yahoo group. Our facebook page and twitter feed also offer help and tips. PECS users can call/email the office for help or advice. We cover ages 18 months to 100 years! There are no eligibility criteria to use PECS. PECS is appropriate for people of all ages with a wide range of learning difficulties. Originally developed for pre-school children with autism, PECS is now successfully being used with adults and children with a range of communication difficulties. It is never too late to start PECS which can be used in conjunction with other approached such as TEACCH, portage and ABA.",

The children have a range of both stimulating and quiet activities to choose from. Children are encouraged to help plan all our activities. Sometimes our activities will be connected with special events such as Christmas, Easter, Mother’s Day, Fathers Day, and Bonfire Night. We also have a vegetable garden where children grow fruits and vegetables which we sometimes include into our snacks.

        "Description": "Portage is a scheme for teaching pre-school children with special educational needs, new and useful skills in their own homes. The basis of Portage is weekly home visiting, with the Portage worker and the parents/carers working together. The name Portage comes from a town in Wisconsin, USA, where the home teaching scheme was initially developed and evaluated. In England, there are more than 200 Portage Services each supported by a regional branch of the National Portage Association. In Lincolnshire there are eight Portage Teams funded by Lincolnshire County Council through the Education and Cultural Services Directorate. Financial resources are placed in eight special schools countywide to promote, develop and maintain the work of the Portage Teams across Lincolnshire. The Portage Home Visitor works with parents in their home because young children initially learn best in the security of their own home with the people who know them. The Portage Home Visitor visits the family at home weekly or fortnightly and plans activities with the parents/carers. Every activity is written down, as is every success. Each child’s progress is reviewed at least every three months and the need for ongoing Portage is discussed. Portage is a home visiting educational service for pre-school children with special educational needs. These may be pre-school children who have learning difficulties, delays in their development and/or physical difficulties. The Portage Teams aim to help families by working with them in their home, helping them to meet the needs of their child. Children can be referred from birth by parents/carers or any agency involved with the child such as health visitors, general practitioners, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, educational psychologists, physiotherapists, paediatricians etc.",

Green RoomOur Green Room provides a cosy and stimulating area for our youngest children. The small group of 9 children ensures that all children are provided with high quality care and each child is valued as an individual. As well as a large playroom, the Green Room has a separate sleep room. A cosy and quiet area away from the hustle and bustle of the main room. The Green Room routine is flexible to ensure that all children’s sleep and meal routines are considered as well as involving a number of stimulating activities to support individual development. We use treasure baskets, natural resources as well as Baby Babble time to ensure all children have access to a multi-sensory experience.  Yellow and Blue Rooms The older children are based downstairs and have access to two playrooms. Children can explore our sensory areas and water trays and also have access to role-play such as shoe shops, doctors or vets depending on their interests. We have a cosy corner where the children can have a rest or read a story. We encourage the children to develop personal and social skills and to become more and more independent. The children select their own resources and are actively involved in preparing their own snacks. Once a week the older children go on a trip in the afternoon and learn about our surroundings and our community. Trips include the cathedral, library, Collection Museum, shopping for fruit and vegetables at the market and to visit our friends at a local carehome.  Each child in all rooms has their own key person and this key person will plan activities based on each individual’s needs, development or interests. This means that each child has something that will interest them and motivate them to become active learners. Outdoors Our garden is large and spacious, and we ensure we provide children with the same quality learning experience that we provide indoors. We go out in all weathers and the children benefit from natural and open-ended large-scale equipment that they do not have access to indoors. We have a cosy corner where children can watch the birds at the bird table or have a story. A number of dens to explore as well as a digging area to search for worms or even treasure. We have a number of resources for children to develop their physical skills including bikes, cars, scooters and large wooden building bricks.",

Information and support can be made available to help young adults make choices about what they want to do in the future with regard to getting a job, taking part in voluntary work, finding day opportunities, taking part in activities, exploring opportunities for more independent living and staying healthy and happy. Young adults and their parents or carers can be supported to find out about eligibility for adult care and support, personal budgets, direct payments and community supported living.",

        "Description": "Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School Alford  Our aims:   To develop the full potential of each individual pupil To develop pride in achievements and an atmosphere which encourages respect and understanding for one another and the world in which we live To provide appropriate and varied opportunities for everyone To provide sensible guidance, support and advice To develop a good work ethic and environment    Our commitment   Queen Elizabeth's Grammar, Alford believes that all pupils have a right to a broad, balanced, relevant and inclusive curriculum that challenges them to achieve academic and personal success. The academy aims to encourage and foster the development of all pupils. It is our intention to identify any barriers to learning at an early stage and to ensure that provision is put in place for any specific needs or difficulties. To ensure these needs are supported successfully there is a graduated response that includes teachers, parents and pupils. A particular source of pride has been the attainment of our pupils with a range of special needs and disabilities. Pupils with special needs have travelled to Australia in a leadership challenge and some have progressed to Oxbridge. The school is absolutely committed to the principles of equality which has been espoused in recent legislation. As well as an excellent academic education, which aims to develop the whole person, we believe that our pupils have an entitlement to an education which is focused on this wider aspect. A pupil will receive support and guidance in a range of ways – from their personal tutor, their mentor, their Special Needs and Disabilities Co-ordinator and teaching assistants (where appropriate), their subject teachers and from the senior team, who also share in the teaching programme and in individual support for  pupils. Our pupils should feel welcomed, safe and secure. We take a very firm line if a pupil feels they have been bullied or treated unkindly or unfairly by others. The school offers a core of spirituality and morality, in its whole school ethos and in its learning programmes. We aspire to develop good lifelong study and learning skills as well as strong interpersonal skills which will help them to relate effectively with others in their future personal, social leisure and work lives. We aim to provide a strong programme of careers guidance which will help pupils to come to appropriate and successful decisions in their future transition to further and higher education and the world of work.   History, background and beliefs  Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar, Alford is a relatively small selective academy located in the rural town of Alford. The school selects pupils based on their eleven plus attainment and for sixth form education their GCSE point score and was ranked \"Outstanding\" in its most recent Ofsted report. The school consistently achieves high GCSE and A level results and it is proud of the progress and achievement of its pupils. For many years the school has been one of the highest achieving schools in the county. The Good Schools Guide which takes into account a range of different indicators to evaluate a school's performance (including achievement, attendance, teaching, how well the school is preparing pupils for the future and whether it is improving) ranked the school in the top 250 out of over 3,000 schools nationally in 2019. Queen Elizabeth’s was founded in 1566 and we celebrated our 450th anniversary in 2016. We are now a Selective Academy, currently having approximately 570 pupils on roll. We value achievement, mutual respect, integrity and self-discipline. With its caring, friendly and aspirational ethos, pupils are well-known individually and valued. We place emphasis on supporting one another and mutual respect - students’ behaviour clearly reflects this around school, in their charitable work and the way they treat one another. The school’s motto is ‘Cor Unum via Una’ – one in heart and goal. We value hard work and encourage students to strive for excellence in all fields of their lives. Students are prepared for life beyond school with the academic, social and emotional skills they will need, whilst ensuring they have fun and enjoy their time at school, building strong friendships and gaining the confidence they will require to excel. Formerly a Business & Enterprise College, students are encouraged to be enterprising and departments all have good links with the business world. Students can set up their own businesses, trading in school, and there is a venture fund to support them. We recognise the value of developing the whole person and therefore provide an extensive range of extra-curricular activities (run by staff and senior students) and many leadership opportunities. These include an annual Y12 Study Tour to Australia, a biannual World Challenge Expedition (Nepal in 2018 and Ecuador in 2020), the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme and a bespoke Leadership Award Scheme. Recent government funding (PSBP2) is providing us with a sports hall, activities studio, science lab and 2 classrooms, due to be open in Autumn 2019. We are very proud of our students and their wide-ranging achievements. These have included:  In our Charity Week last year raising over £11,000 for Young Minds 2019’s A Level results of 79% A*-B being the best ever in Lincolnshire, and this year’s GCSE and A Level results placing us top in the County and East Midlands Our GCSE Progress 8 and 100% 4+ in Maths and English (93% 5+) placing us 33rd in UK (and top in County) Consistently high Value-Added at all key stages and across all groups of students Pupils and staff maintaining a school garden, which supplies some fruit and vegetables to the canteen Our school radio station run by students Regional Girls’ Tennis Champions District Champions for Y8 Boys’ Rugby, Y7 and Y10 Rounders, KS4 Tennis A recent outstanding production of ‘The Phantom of the Opera’  This information can only, provide you with a flavour of Queen Elizabeth’s. Probably the most impressive feature of the School is the pupils. To appreciate fully the way we work, we strongly recommend that you pay us a visit, especially parents of children who have special educational needs and disabilities when you can meet the SENDCo, the headteacher the teachers and our pupils.",

I am a fully qualified teacher with over 15 years of experience, specialising in the early years. I have always had a passion for learning and have found many ways to encourage and stimulate children to learn in their own individual ways. As every child is unique, their learning should be tailored to their interests as well as their individual needs. I am a middle child of four and have grown up with my siblings close in age. I remember from the age of 8 I developed an interest in other children, seeing the differences. I used to help with respite care for disabled children as part of community youth activity my church supported. I moved around the United Kingdom a lot as a child which enabled me to become adaptable to many situations, as well as experiencing different teaching methods at various schools. I am a married mother of 4 children, with over 18 years experience of both my own children and my 16 nieces and nephews. I learned very quickly, that as a parent, every child is completely unique, and so have developed many strategies to manage behaviour as well as encourage a love of learning in each of my children. I do not believe in violence of any kind, as all forms are detrimental to all parties involved. I teach through love, clear boundaries and teaching right from wrong. I have found every child who is loved and feels secure will soar in their learning because they will be instilled in a belief that they can succeed. I have a passion for children of all ages, and I enjoy spending time with a tiny baby as much as a babbling crawler; a frustrated toddler and an inquisitive chatterbox. I love to get to know all children that have been under my care and tutelage, and every child holds a place of fondness in my heart.

Our occupational therapists provide assessments of need regarding a disabled child/young person's ability to access their home for carrying out essential activities of daily living.  Essential activities include but are not limited to personal care (washing, dressing, toileting); mealtimes, sleep and transfers associated with these. We can also assess for aspects relating to safety for a disabled child engaging in essential activities at home.

The children's occupational therapy team provides specialist assessments for children with physical disabilities, complex medical needs and/or significantly challenging behaviours which impact on their ability to access and carry out essential activities safely.  These assessments are completed at the child's main residence and some short breaks units. We are based in Sleaford covering all of the Lincolnshire County Council localities.

        "Description": "Sense College Loughborough is a small specialist college based in the heart of Loughborough in Leicestershire, offering daytime services to young people with a wide range of disabilities. Through our in-house enterprise curriculum and partnership with Loughborough College, we support students to achieve their targets and goals using individual learning plans. Students have a wide range of disabilities including learning difficulties, autism, Asperger's Syndrome, sight loss, communication problems, physical disabilities, chronic illness and hearing loss. The main aim of the College is to prepare people for as fulfilling an adult life as possible by maximising independence.  The curriculum philosophy of the College is for learning to be as practically based as possible, using adult environments, including the College enterprises and work experience placements. Further Education: At Sense College Loughborough, there are opportunities for students working at all levels to develop important skills. Based in one of the education pathways (Sensory, Creative & Enterprise, Vocational), each student has an individually tailored timetable. The College's enterprise learning environment will give you lots of opportunity to develop skills in a realistic setting. For instance if one of the areas that you are keen to develop is your communication skills, you could do this on the reception in our eBay shop, or delivering office supplies to staff for the College Office, or on the till in our Cafeteria. If you need speech and language or physiotherapy you’ll have our therapies team to call upon.  When you start they will assess you and ensure that the appropriate support is embedded into your day-to-day activities around the College. As part of your time with us you will also develop your literacy and numeracy and IT skills in small group sessions.  You will then be able to use the new things you have learnt in the classroom in a practical enterprise environment. We will work with you and support you to develop the skills you will need once you have finished your Further Education course with us.  This could be going to a mainstream college, moving into employment or voluntary work, or maybe living more independently and getting out more into the local community. Our Further Education programme is available to you if you are between 16-25 years old.  If you are interested in finding out more, come and visit. If you decide to apply we will arrange an assessment visit where you will spend the day meeting different members of the College team.  Together we will look at what you want to get out of studying with us and work jointly to establish your goals.  We then develop a programme with structured targets which all focus on what you want. We have a partnership with Loughborough College: Have you seen a course at Loughborough College but would still like support from us? If so, that’s not a problem; you can be a student with Sense College Loughborough and at the same time do a qualification at Loughborough College.  This means you get the best of both worlds: your preferred qualification with support from us and help in developing your independence. How to Apply: If you are interested in our Further Education you can contact us and arrange a visit.  Following on from the visit, if you would like to apply to us, you will need to complete our application forms.  We will then invite you in for an assessment and will contact your school for more information.  If you are interested in us then please let your school know during your transition review, so that they can record that this is where you would like to go for your Further Education.",

        "Description": "I've recently set up an organisation called Siblinks offering a structured block of support groups for siblings of disabled children.   It's a safe environment for siblings of disabled children to talk freely about their experiences as a sibling and the mixed feelings that provokes within them. There will also be esteem building activities, a chance for them to do activities that aren't easy for them to do at home such as arts, crafts or just play games with other children. The most important thing I feel though is to give these children an opportunity to meet other children in similar situations to themselves. Having another child they can relate to will help relieve their feelings of isolation.",

        "Name": "Sibsey Free Primary School",
        "Description": "We are a small rural primary school just north of Boston.  There are 175 pupils on roll organized across 6 classes.  We have a strong link with Bright Sparks Pre-School which is located on our site. Our school works collaboratively with four other local primary schools to share best practice. We run a range of out of school clubs and lunchtime clubs, e.g. football, dance, art and crafts, musical drama, choir, etc.  We also hold study support clubs. Predominately, the needs of children are met through High Quality First Teaching by Teachers in the classroom.  They plan, assess and oversee each child’s learning and progress carefully with regular feedback being given to the SENCO.  Class Teachers also meet parents on a regular basis to discuss their child’s achievements, needs and next steps.  The SENCO/Assistant SENCO oversees all support and achievement of any child requiring additional support across the school.  The Assistant SENCO liaises closely with parents, and with outside agencies and other professionals to ensure there is support for the child, and for staff and parents.  A Vision Statement for Sibsey Free School: Our vision is for each child to leave us with a confidence built on an extensive range of basic skills. We aim for them to be knowledgeable, enthusiastic and to take pleasure in the world around them. They will be able to listen to and evaluate the views of others, with respect and tolerance yet share their own views confidently and be capable of independent thought. Children should leave us with happy memories and varied experiences that they will treasure throughout their lives. The Aims and Values of Sibsey Free School: • We will aim to maintain a safe, caring, friendly, stable, stimulating and disciplined environment where individuals will learn and will develop to the best of their ability. • The school will aim to create an environment where all members of the school community are happy, enthusiastic, confident and valued. • Everyone will be respected and valued for their own particular talents, with cooperation and tolerance actively encouraged throughout the school. • All members of the school community will be provided with the opportunity to contribute towards the development and ethos of the school. • All members of the school community will receive encouragement in their work and the opportunity to develop educationally and professionally. • Equal opportunities will be provided for all. • The curriculum will be balanced and broadly based nurturing the spiritual, moral, social, cultural, academic and physical development of all children. • We aim to create an atmosphere in which all children are encouraged to learn from first-hand experience and have positive and enthusiastic attitudes to all aspects of their lives. • High standards in both work and play are expected and encouraged at every opportunity whilst everyone’s achievement and effort will be recognised and celebrated. • The education of the children is a joint venture between the home and school and therefore we aim to foster a good home/school partnership with the school being accessible to parents. • We have close links with the church and the local community, helping all to have respect for, and awareness of, their responsibilities towards the school, the community in which they live and the wider world community. • Through teamwork and communication between staff, parents and governors we aim to develop positive relationships amongst all members of the school. Safeguarding Statement Our school is committed to safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of all our children. We expect all staff, governors, volunteers and visitors to share this same commitment to safeguarding. Each child’s welfare is of paramount importance. We recognise that, safeguarding concerns do not adhere to school/home boundaries and that what happens at home and within the wider school environment including on social media, is as relevant as what happens within the school environment. Behaviour may be challenging and we recognise that, at times, this may impact on other children either directly or indirectly. We will always take a considered and sensitive approach in order that we can support all our children. We listen to our pupils and take seriously what they tell us. All school staff are trained in safeguarding, and children are made aware that they can talk to adults in school if they have any concerns.   All our policies and procedures follow the guidance contained in KCISE. We are also aware of other relevant guidance, such as the sexual violence and sexual harassment between children in schools and colleges. The procedures which we follow, for the safety of all, have been laid down by the Lincolnshire Safeguarding Team and the school has adopted a Child Protection Policy in line with this. On rare occasions our concerns about a child may mean that we have to consult other agencies. We will ensure that all concerns are discussed with parent/carers first, before any referrals are made, unless we believe that such a move may be contrary to a child’s welfare.   The Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) is Mr Graeme Wright (Headteacher). The Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead is Mrs Tracey Howsam (Pines Class Teacher and EYFS Lead). The Designated Person for Looked After and Post Looked After Children is Graeme Wright. The Pupil Premium Champion is Graeme Wright. The Child Protection Policy is available on the school website. If you are concerned about the safety of a child, you can email the DSL on graeme.wright@sibsey.lincs.sch.uk   Inclusion Statement: Sibsey Free School is committed to enabling all children to reach their full potential, having full access to a broad, balanced and relevant education, to be fully included in the School community, and as a result, make a successful transition to secondary education and so into adulthood. All Pupils will learn best in a school where they are valued for who they are and for the unique contributions they make to the school community.  This is part of the whole ethos of Sibsey Free School. We promote the inclusion of all children and recognise the particular needs of those with SEND (Special Educational Needs or Disabilities), i.e. children with Specific Learning Difficulties (e.g. dyslexia), those with sensory or physical impairments, and those with speech and language difficulties.  Staff also recognise and understand the needs of children who demonstrate characteristics within the autistic spectrum, and also those with Social, Emotional or Mental Health Difficulties. The specific needs of those children with medical difficulties will also be met so far as we are able. We will endeavour to ensure that the needs of all children are understood and met as far as is possible, and this includes the needs of Looked After children. Other Information: The School has achieved the Autism Inclusion Mark 4 Lincolnshire (AIM4Lincs), Healthy School Award, ECO Silver Award, Bronze School Council Award and Gold Award for School Sports Mark. At every opportunity we ensure that children are involved in making decisions about life in school. We encourage our children to be involved in decisions that affect them and they are regularly asked for their contributions in order to improve our educational provision. Likewise we encourage and promote the active involvement of parents and carers in the life of the school and in helping us improve the provision for their children. Parents and carers are consulted at all stages when additional support is needed and also asked about how successful we have been in meeting the needs of their children. We respond to all comments and advice given and will continue to develop the essential partnership that exists between parents/carers and the school. When it is clear that advice from outside agencies is required we will ensure that we are totally committed to gaining that help and guidance.  We are regularly involved with a variety of support agencies across a range of areas, e.g. Specialist Teaching Team, Educational Psychologist, Social Communication/Autism Outreach Support (The Working Together Team), Speech and Language Therapist, Behaviour Outreach Support Service. We pride ourselves on the fact that we are quick to establish intervention strategies and support at an early stage when challenges are evident. This has helped to ensure that the vast majority of children who initially are identified with SEN&D are seen to progress quickly and move forward positively. Children with significant challenges are supported throughout their time with us in the most effective way, according to their needs.",

        "Description": "Mission Statement At Boston St. Mary’s School we will provide a high standard of teaching and learning opportunities ensuring excellence and enjoyment for all. As we grow in the love of God we aim to respect and care for one another in our daily lives. Within our diverse school community, Religious Education reaches out at all times and in all areas of the curriculum. The Catholic faith is shared through the experience of living, working and praying together through the Scriptures, the Liturgy and the Doctrine. “Since every person of whatever race, condition and age is endowed with human dignity, he/she has an inalienable right to an education corresponding to his/her proper destiny and suited to his/her talents.” (Gravissimum Educationis) Introduction The school supports the aims of the UNICEF charter on Rights and Responsibilities of the child with respect to education. In Articles 28 and 29 of the charter it states that all children have a right to an education but with this comes the responsibility to make the most of that education and to ensure that others are able to make the most of their education also. Teaching and learning at St. Mary’s aims to provide pupils with numerous opportunities to engage with different aspects of the curriculum, both independently and working in groups. Pupils will be encouraged to appreciate the social benefits of engagement with the curriculum and will take part in activities that will allow them to explore and develop an understanding and awareness of different cultures. This again links to the UNICEF charter and the mission statement of the school which highlight the need for all children to develop mutual respect and understanding. Background Pupils have positive attitudes to learning. All groups make good progress from their different starting points and leave school at the end of Year 6 with attainment that is above average in English and Mathematics. Behaviour and safety are good. Both in lessons and around the school, pupils' behaviour creates a positive learning and playing environment. They are courteous and friendly to visitors. Pupils feel safe and understand how to stay safe. From the Early Years Foundation Stage onwards, regular routines and expectations, together with clearly understood rewards and sanctions, result in a positive, supportive and happy atmosphere for learning and playing. There is close liaison with external agencies to meet the needs of pupils whose circumstances make them most vulnerable and potentially disaffected. Promotion of equality of opportunity is at the heart of the school's work, creating a harmonious and positive atmosphere. The school is inclusive and there is no evidence of discrimination. Safeguarding policies and procedures are good. They are reviewed regularly, so that adults and pupils have a good understanding of safety issues - Ofsted 2012. The school was awarded Healthy School Status in 2010 and has had its award updated since. It also holds a Gold Arts Award for its commitment to Art and Music. The school had its UNICEF Rights Respecting Award renewed in January 2014",

        "Description": "Stickney Primary School is a Church of England school in a small rural village about 8 miles north of Boston. There are approximately 170 pupils on roll. The children are organised into 7 single age classes at the beginning of the academic year. Grouping of pupils for tasks is carefully planned, as are activities, to meet the needs of all children. We are able to group children according to ability by using our team of experienced teaching assistants working very closely with our teachers. Our motto, and our main aim, is for everyone to “Learn, Enjoy and Achieve”. Our ethos is one of a team working towards this aim and striving for excellence. We have a talented team of staff who can provide a smooth transition for your child joining our school and we always strive to meet the needs of all pupils. We work closely in partnership with the home, the Church and the local community, to be supportive and treat all members with mutual respect. We aim to be a caring Christian community that teaches and nurtures Christian values and welcomes children and families of all faith, backgrounds and of none. Our church school values are friendship, kindness, respect, trust, fairness, honesty and perseverance. The school has strong links with the local secondary schools and pre-school (which is located on our site). We believe strongly in the importance of partnership working and ensuring children have a smooth transition to their new school, which is paramount for children with Special Educational Needs & Disabilities (SEND). The William Lovell Academy (secondary school) is next door to us with an internal path from our school field leading directly to the Academy’s grounds. The Academy  organises transition activities for our Year 6 pupils, such as visits to experience school lunches and other induction activities. Our school works collaboratively and very closely with 2 other local, rural primary schools in Lincolnshire. This means that our staff are able to share best practice and work together taking advantage of some of the benefits of belonging to a larger school, whilst retaining our individual identities. Our school curriculum was graded as “outstanding” at our Ofsted Inspection in 2013. Our “creative curriculum” aims to encompass all subject areas and enables us to provide a high standard of teaching and learning. We have adopted a highly practical and cross-curricular approach and we endeavour to equip our pupils with the skills required to be independent and responsible citizens.   We are very proud to have our own purpose built 'Kitchen Pod', together with a cook and kitchen assistant who provide nutritious hot school meals which comply with the School Food Standards.  We have 'theme' days and can provide for any dietary requirements that we are made aware of.  Our menu is regularly reviewed and changes with the seasons as well as making use of the fresh produce from the school garden when it is available. The school runs a breakfast club for the benefit of parents which is open from 8am until the beginning of the school day. There are also many extra-curricular activities that the pupils can participate in, both at lunchtime and after school. We are able to utilise our excellent outdoor facilities, such as our wildlife area, a poly tunnel and a large field for many of these club activities. The outdoor area is also used widely in our classroom activities and we encourage our pupils to grow and prepare many types of fruit and vegetables in our school “Food for Life” project. We are close to achieving our Bronze Food for Life award. The staff also organise a range of trips for our pupils. The year 6 class have a residential trip experience and other classes go on day trips to places of interest usually linked to their class topics and our creative curriculum. The school also has “Enhanced Healthy School” status and all the staff promotes the need for a healthy lifestyle. Stickney Primary is an inclusive school and all members of staff involved are well trained and are constantly refreshing their knowledge and expertise through relevant courses. We have our Aim4Lincs Award for being an autistic friendly school. Our experienced Special Educational Needs & Disabilities Co‑Ordinator (SENDCo), Mrs R Thompson, oversees all support and achievement of any child requiring additional support across the school. The SENDCo also liaises closely with all outside agencies and other professionals to provide full support for the child and advice for staff and parents. The agencies include STAPS (Specialist Teaching and Applied Psychology Service); Lincolnshire Social Communication Including Autism Pathfinder Outreach Team (A National Autistic Society (NAS) Accredited Service); Pathways, from Lincolnshire’s Teaching and Learning Centre, School Nursing Team; Teachers from the Sensory Impaired Service, Speech and Language Therapy Team and Parent Support Advisers and Family Support Workers. The SENDCo is also available to talk to any parent at all parent consultation evenings as well as being available for an appointment to discuss any concerns or queries throughout the year. Class teachers oversee, plan and assess each child’s learning and progress carefully and feedback information on a regular basis to the SENDCo. Class teachers also meet with parents on a regular basis to discuss their child’s achievements, needs and next steps. We believe in a close partnership with parents/carers of all our pupils but especially with parents with special needs. We can also offer advice to parents/carers on practical ways of helping their child at home. Pupils with special educational needs achieve well at Stickney Primary. At the end of Year 6 last year 100% of pupils with special needs made expected progress in Maths and Reading. 100% of the pupils on school action plus made expected progress overall (source: RAISEonline). The number of SEND pupils achieving level 4+ last year was considerably higher than the national average in Maths, Reading and Writing. This year (2014) our teacher assessment results indicate that there will be a high percentage of SEND pupils achieving level 4+ in all three subjects and about 20% achieving level 5 or above.",

These are koinonia (working together), respect, perseverance and wisdom. Our values underpin all we do as a school to develop the whole child. Phonics is taught in small groups through the Read, Write, Inc program which ensures children receive small group input for phonics which is assessed regularly to ensure they build systematically on previous knowledge whilst developing new skills. Class teachers plan lessons which are carefully differentiated to ensure each child can learn and make progress across the curriculum. At Westmere Primary we are excited about our new curriculum. We believe children should experience the world first hand as much as possible and consequently plan a variety of experiences for our children including trips out of school as well as inviting visitors into school. We actively seek to work closely with all families and operate an open door policy here at Westmere. Parents are encouraged to come into school to share concerns or worries.",

We believe that children learn by playing and exploring, being active, and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both indoors and outside. The sessions are organised so that children have free choice, and can play with a wide variety of toys and activities. Each day children will have the opportunity for messy play, painting and other crafts, construction, small world play, role play, mark making, books, a relaxing cosy corner for resting, and outdoor play. Along with adult-led activities such as key group time and circle time, we ensure that your child is ready for the school environment. We also enjoy cooking activities, exploring and learning about the local area, and dancing and music. We like to take our children out of the setting on occasions, for example a walk to the local shops to buy snack ingredients, park or beach. Risk assessments are carried out for these walks and can be located on our walls. Although our sessions are very flexible, we do have a routine as this helps children to feel settled. A few times a week, weather permitting, we have Beach School sessions. Our Manager has achieved a Level 3 Beach Schools Practical Skills and Environmental Management course which enables children to get the most out of being on the beach.

Our School has a Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCo) who is responsible for the  management of provision and support for identified pupils with SEND. They will also coach and support teachers and other staff to enable them to provide appropriate assessment and focussed provision for children in their class with SEND.

        "Description": "Did you know that sign language has been proven to be an effective form of communication for babies? If you consider the frustrations felt by babies then you'll understand the benefits signing can provide for both the parent and child.  Many children naturally use gestures and pointing but signing allows them to be specific about their needs. It takes the guesswork out and dramatically reduces frustration resulting in less stress for everybody concerned!  They can begin learning right from birth but won't have the dexterity to begin to sign until around four to six months. First signs are usually things that are most important to them such as 'milk'. This can then develop onto more complex signing as they grow such as signing 'teeth', 'hurt' and 'medicine' for when they have teething pain. The key to success is to reinforce the signs whenever possible and ensure the sign is used alongside the spoken word. The signs are not used on their own because the point of signing with babies is not to replace the spoken language but to enhance it. Many question the potential impact signing could have on the development of speech. You may be surprised to learn that signing not only encourages early speech but can also result in a wider vocabulary. Some wonder if the classes will be taught in the style of a typical lesson as essentially, they are gaining an education and skill. Sessions have been designed to be delivered in the most age appropriate way so songs, puppets, musical instruments and bubbles are used to enrich the learning process and create an atmosphere of fun. Children of all ages love doing actions along to songs but Baby Signing takes it a step further and teaches them something that will be of great use to them now and in the future.",

        "Name": "Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) Scheme",
        "Description": "What is the CHIP scheme? The CHIP scheme aims to help Lincolnshire families keep their children safe from home accidents. Accidents in and around the home are a leading cause of preventable death and disability for children under 5 years old. How does the CHIP scheme work? Home safety interventions that include a combination of home safety assessment, parent education and provision and fitting of safety equipment can be effective in preventing child accidents in the home.  The CHIP scheme provides a range of resources to staff and volunteers working with families so they can support families with accident prevention. There's also an equipment fitting service that families can be referred to if they need safety equipment. CHIP Assessment The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that homes with children under 5 have a 'structured home safety assessment' to identify and address any child injury risks in the home. The purpose of the CHIP assessment is help practitioners:  take a systematic approach to identifying child injury risk in the home give consistent safety advice according to the latest evidence, and keep a record of identified risks and the action taken to mitigate them.  The assessment looks at risks associated with developmental milestones as there's a strong link between the types of accidents children are involved in and their stage of development. It also takes a Sign of Safety approach, encouraging families to think about what's working well and what actions can be taken to make their children safer. The CHIP assessment can be downloaded at the bottom of the page. It comes with a guide containing all the safety messages relating to each question on the assessment.  You can complete the assessment online and on submission a copy will be sent to your email address. It's also available on Mosaic so it can be added to a child/family's record. CHIP Training Parent education plays an important role in preventing child accidents in the home. Staff and volunteers working with families are in a great position to educate parents and carers about child injuries and how they can be prevented.   The CHIP e-learning module is a must-do for anyone who works with children under 5 years of age or supports families with children under 5. It takes around 20 minutes and by the end practitioners will be able to:  Identify what causes the most common and serious injuries in the under 5s and what can be done to prevent them Explain the link between child development and injuries Find useful resources to help you prevent accidents.  Here's how to access the course:  Go to: https://safeguardinglincolnshire.vc-enable.co.uk.  Instructions of how to register are attached. Click 'Learning' Click 'Available learning' Type 'Chip' into search bar. 'Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) E-Learning' will appear Click 'Start' and then click 'Start' again Click 'Download' and then open the PowerPoint Click 'Slide Show' once in the document and click through it using the mouse or spacebar Once finished, click 'Next' in the e-learning site and it'll take you to a quiz. Complete the quiz to gain a certificate.  CHIP Visits Click here to refer. Please read the information below before referring.  Be aware that the fire service is operating a reduced home visiting service at the moment, and only high risk cases will be considered for a CHIP visit. You can submit your referral and the fire service will make arrangements to visit once services return to normal. If you feel that the case is high risk – i.e. there's an imminent and high risk of child injury and the installation of equipment can reduce that risk – then please email chips@lincolnshire.gov.uk with your referral with further information. CHIP Visits are provided by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue (LFR). Upon referral, LFR will visit the household and supply/fit safety equipment as necessary. This may include:  Safety gates (to prevent access to and falls on stairs) Window restrictors (to prevent falls from windows) Fire guards (to prevent access to open fires) Cupboard locks (to prevent access to cupboards containing medicines and poisonous household chemicals) Blind cord cleats (to prevent access to blind cords which could cause entanglement and suffocation) Hair-straightener pouches (to prevent burns from hot hair straighteners)  They will also undertake a home fire safety check which includes escape planning with the family and installation of smoke or CO alarms, if needed. Referrals for CHIP Visits can only be made by Early Help Workers, Early Years Practitioners, Health Visitors, Family Health Workers and Social Workers. The referral form will ask for a copy of the household's CHIP Assessment. This demonstrates the need for equipment and evidences that home safety has been discussed with the family. It’s important to note that LFR's responsibility is to assess for and fit safety equipment according to manufacturer's instructions and best practice. It is not LFR's responsibility to educate parents about accident prevention – this is the responsibility of the referring practitioner. Evidence shows that the provision and installation of safety equipment is only successful in preventing injuries when combined with parent education. The CHIP e-learning and assessment tool are designed to support practitioners with this. CHIP Visits are targeted at households where children are at greatest risk of injury. The following characteristics indicate that a child may be at high risk:  They live in areas of deprivation They live in rented accommodation, poor quality housing or homes of multiple occupancy Their parents are unemployed or have never worked Their parent’s ability to supervise is impaired (i.e. due to mental health problems, health/care needs, substance misuse, number of children in property) They have young or single parents with poor support networks Their parents can’t afford safety equipment.  The following eligibility criteria is therefore applied. The child/family must be on:  Child protection plan Child in Need assessment/plan Early Support Care Co-ordination (ESCO) Team Around the Child (TAC) plan Income Based Jobseekers Allowance; Income Related Employment Support Allowance; Income Support. Also including Universal Credit Working Tax Credits or Child Tax Credits Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit  Some points to consider before referring:  Ensure you have consent of the parent/carer If the parent/carer is a tenant they will need to have permission from their landlord Be aware that LFR will not install safety gates unless there is a child aged less than 24 months in the property You will be notified with details of action taken during the visit. Please retain this in the child/family record.  Useful resources Child Milestone Cards. Lincolnshire County Council has produced 6 child milestone cards for families to remember and celebrate their child's first developmental milestones (see Downloads). On the back of each card is advice on how to keep children safe from accidents as they grow and learn new skills. They can be used for displays and campaigns or as teaching resources in one-to-one or group sessions on child safety. When professionally printed they make a great gift for families.   Public Health England's Preventing Unintentional Injuries Guide is for all staff working with children under 5 years and covers data, actions for practitioners and safety messages for parents and carers. The Keeping Children Safe at Home research programme, led by University of Nottingham, has produced an Injury Prevention Briefing with ideas for activities, education and training for practitioners working with children and families. The Lullaby Trust has excellent, easy-read safe sleep resources. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Parent Hub has advice for parents on keeping their under 5s safe. The Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT) is the UK’s leading charity working to reduce the number of children and young people killed, disabled or seriously injured in accidents. Below in the downloads is a safety messages card game and answer sheet. This is a good game to play with parents and teaches about potential risks and how to reduce or eliminate them. Print off the sheet, cut into cards, shuffle and get people to match the hazard with the correct safety advice. Further information Please contact chips@lincolnshire.gov.uk.",

        "Description": "Community paediatrics in Lincolnshire is part of a combined children’s service provided by United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust. The community paediatric service provides a secondary service for children referred from primary care, hospital and community health professionals, schools and the local education authority when there are concerns about a child’s development, behaviour or educational needs. It is consultant led and doctors generally work within defined geographical patches. All are encouraged to have specific areas of interest/responsibility. Children are seen in a variety of settings i.e. clinic, school, hospital or home. There is close working with schools, Lincolnshire children’s services (education and social care) and other health colleagues. There are well-established links with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams. Child development clinics operate in Boston, Grantham and Lincoln involving multidisciplinary professionals and provide opportunities for joint assessment and coordination of services for children with more severe or complex developmental disabilities. Specialist clinics are also held for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the community and for children with hearing impairment at the local district general hospital. The community paediatric service also provides statutory support to Lincolnshire children’s services in relation to children with special educational needs and children being placed for adoption.  New Community Paediatric Referral Process – Schools   From January 2022, a new referral process has been put in place for the Lincolnshire Community Paediatric Service to help reduce the number of referrals rejected due to lack of detail and ensure children are placed consistently and fairly onto the appropriate pathway and in a timely manner.    Schools are expected to be the primary source of most referrals into the service. Schools are best placed to know the child's needs, and how these impact on their behaviours within school and at home. We have engaged with schools through workshops and communications to ensure they are aware of this. Lincolnshire GPs are being asked to re-route children, young people (CYP) and families to their schools for them to lead on making referrals to Community Paediatrics. For pre-school age children (0-4 years), GPs should inform the parent/carer to speak to a Health Visitor (01522 843000) and/or their Early Years Setting who can offer advice, support and signposting; or will support a referral to Community Paediatrics if appropriate. If a CYP is out of education, referrals can be made by a Health Visitor or Children and Young People’s Nurse (01522 843000) or a GP can make the referral if necessary. GPs will still make referrals into the service for CYP moving into area with a known need/diagnosis requiring follow up and babies/toddlers with complex medical/health needs, including genetic syndromes.    New School Referral Forms  The new, simplified referral forms will be the only form accepted for schools making a referral into the service from January 2022. Submitting a referral in an alternative format will result in the referral being returned and will lead to a delay in CYP accessing a service. Once fully completed, these forms should be emailed to LHNT.community-paediatrics@nhs.net",

        "Description": "Early support for families ensures children receive the very best start in life. We believe that actively involving parents in their child’s early learning contributes positively towards their long‑term development. Our approach From the very beginning, we recognised the value of learning through play and the important role of parents in this process. The benefits have been acknowledged by Government and addressed in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. We continue to lead the sector in this area by delivering services which use play to promote learning and development. Baby and Toddler groups Baby and toddler groups, or stay and play sessions, are extremely popular with young families. We offer practical advice and support to over 2500 groups and deliver quality baby and toddler sessions to thousands of families every year. The benefits of these groups are enormous. Parents, babies and toddlers can:  enjoy positive and playful time together in an informal, friendly space. use a variety of resources and take part in activities. meet with qualified childcare practitioners who can offer advice and support. socialise with other families in a more relaxed, natural way which helps to build supportive, positive communities.  We have useful information about starting a baby and toddler group. Support and advice for parents As a parent you are your child’s first and most important educator. Research shows that parental support for children’s learning has a direct impact on how well they do, both in early years settings and also later on in life, and it is widely recognised that the learning that takes place in childcare settings builds upon vital home experiences with parents. Information and advice The Alliance actively promotes and supports parental involvement in all our work. We offer impartial information and advice to help you find out more about care and education for young children, so you can make an informed decision about the childcare that is right for your child. We also support parents and children by offering affordable childcare provision, discounted books and resources, family learning programmes and adult training.

        "Description": "Early Years and Childcare Support is committed to working in partnership with all Early Years providers, Early Years Locality Teams and professionals to achieve the highest standards of inclusive, quality early years provision for children and families. Early Years and Childcare Support seeks to provide a range of activities and services by working with all early years providers and the county’s network of Children’s Centres, which aim to improve parent and child attachment, child development, school readiness and the prevention of escalation to specialist services. The government’s Early Help offer recognises that preventing problems or interventions as soon as they are identified is essential to support the development and achievement of children. Well targeted early intervention is likely to lead to better outcomes or improve a child’s resilience against poor outcomes. It is therefore critical that all Early Years providers across Lincolnshire are supported and challenged  to provide outstanding  inclusive, quality provision  for Lincolnshire’s youngest children in order that they all achieve ‘good’ outcomes at the end of the Early Years Foundation Stage and have the necessary skills to enable them to achieve their potential throughout school and their adult life.  Early Years and Childcare Support work in partnership with the Early Years Locality teams to provide the following services that contribute to the Early Help offer;  Promoting and supporting the early identification of children aged 0-5 years with additional needs and disabilities in order to improve outcomes. This is implemented by Early Years Specialist Teachers working closely with SENCos to ensure early identification and intervention for children and their families. Monitoring to ensure that effective early intervention and support for children and their families is provided in a timely manner. Support is given to settings to identify developmental delay in young children and provide additional support in a Children’s Centre or an early years setting to help children catch up with their peers. Providing support and advice to promote school readiness and a smooth transition into school, seeking to ensure that all children are ‘school ready’ and in a position to learn and achieve in a school setting. The key focus of the work is on the delivery of early intervention and transition groups to promote school readiness. Ensuring access to sufficient high quality, inclusive early learning and childcare for all children and specifically those aged 3 and 4 years of age who are entitled to the free Early Years Entitlement (EYE). In addition to this, the Service supports  the Local Authority’s duty to ensure the ‘Entitlement for Disadvantaged Two Year Olds’ is delivered to the most vulnerable families within the county and the allocation of Supported Childcare funding to vulnerable families. Supporting settings to identify workforce development and providing programmes for continued professional development to enable the workforce to meet identified priorities for Early Help and for early intervention strategies.  Services are available to all early years providers including early years settings, schools, childminders, Out of School clubs and within Children’s Centres across Lincolnshire. Services can be accessed through the early years provision identified above,  or on request by emailing EYCC@lincolnshire.gov.uk If you are struggling to find a place at a setting, please complete this form to let us know about it",

Almost everything we do involves communication; everyday tasks such as learning at school, asking for food and drink, sorting out problems, making friends and having fun. These all rely on our ability to communicate with each other. Makaton is a language programme using signs and symbols to help people to communicate. It is designed to support spoken language and the signs and symbols are used with speech, in spoken word order. With Makaton, children and adults can communicate straight away using signs and symbols. Many people then drop the signs or symbols naturally at their own pace, as they develop speech. For those who have experienced the frustration of being unable to communicate meaningfully or effectively, Makaton really can help. Makaton takes away that frustration and enables individuals to connect with other people and the world around them. This opens up all kinds of possibilities. Makaton uses signs, symbols and speech to help people communicate. Signs are used, with speech, in spoken word order. This helps provide extra clues about what someone is saying. Using signs can help people who have no speech or whose speech is unclear. Using symbols can help people who have limited speech and those who cannot, or prefer not to sign. Makaton is extremely flexible as it can be personalised to an individual's needs and used at a level suitable for them. It can be used to:  share thoughts, choices and emotions label real objects, pictures, photos and places take part in games and songs listen to, read and tell stories create recipes, menus and shopping lists write letters and messages help people find their way around public buildings  Today over 100,000 children and adults, use Makaton symbols and signs. Most people start using Makaton as children then naturally stop using the signs and symbols as they no longer need them. However, some people will need to use Makaton for their whole lives.",

Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with, and relates to, other people. It also affects how they make sense of the world around them. It is a spectrum condition, which means that, while all people with autism share certain difficulties, their condition will affect them in different ways. Some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support. People with autism may also experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colours. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism. People with Asperger syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language.",

        "Description": "Eczema (also known as dermatitis) is a dry skin condition. It is a highly individual condition which varies from person to person and comes in many different forms. It is not contagious so you cannot catch it from someone else. In mild cases of eczema, the skin is dry, scaly, red and itchy. In more severe cases there may be weeping, crusting and bleeding. Constant scratching causes the skin to split and bleed and also leaves it open to infection. Eczema affects people of all ages but is primarily seen in children. Those who “grow out” of their eczema during early childhood may see it recur again in later life. In the UK, one in five children and one in twelve adults have eczema while eczema and contact dermatitis account for 84-90% of occupational skin disease. Atopic eczema is a genetic condition based on the interaction between a number of genes and environmental factors. In most cases there will be a family history of either eczema or one of the other ‘atopic’ conditions i.e asthma or hay fever. Our confidential telephone and email Helpline is at the heart of our work, providing information, support and reassurance to people struggling to cope with eczema. Each year, thousands of people contact the confidential Eczema Helpline via email or telephone.

A large part of that support comes through our social events - organised to bring families together in a relaxed atmosphere where they can catch up with friends that they have made whilst in hospital and make new friends with families whose children have already completed their treatment. PASIC provides help and support to families in the following ways; PASIC Grants PASIC offers financial support in the form of a grant, given to help families with additional costs which come about as a direct result of the child's illness. Help is given to pay bills such as additional heating, increased phone bills, laundry or travel expenses. Considerations is also given to requests for specific items that are deemed necessary due to restrictions caused by a child's illness Social Activities PASIC organise a variety of social occasions, activities and outings for the whole family. Bringing families together in a relaxed environment helps to relieve stress and build important support networks with other families in a similar situation. Organised activities can be key to bringing families together during what can be an extremely difficult period; when siblings of a seriously ill child are often lacking attention. Communication PASIC produces a quarterly newsletter, which helps parents keep in touch with each other and provides focus on the ways that PASIC is able to help, either through the activities on offer or by sharing other parents messages. Support for teenagers PASIC is currently exploring ways of supporting teenage patients with activities specifically aimed at this age group. PASIC relies on the support of its partners in the hospital, the medical staff, the nursing staff and the social work team, to name but a few, if you think you can help we would love to hear from you.",

Schools have admissions policies in order to identify which children have priority for places if there are more applicants than places available. The local authority is the admission authority for community and controlled schools. The schools use the Lincolnshire County Council admission policy. We have delegated decisions on who should be offered a place to governing bodies but they must do this in line with the County Council policy. We are responsible for coordinating all admissions into Voluntary aided schools, foundation schools, free schools and academies and making sure that parents and carers receive information and an application form. We also make sure that the highest offer of a school place is given if more than one school tell us they can make an offer.  The governors of these schools are responsible for setting their own admission policies. Each individual school can have its own separate admission policy. You can find each school’s admission policy on their website or you can contact them direct. It is important that you read the policies for the schools that you wish to apply to. Information is also available in our ‘Going to School in Lincolnshire’ publication. If you want your own copy please phone us. Information and any questions regarding any aspect of the school admissions and appeals process and how to apply online can be provided by contacting us via phone or email. Before completing your online application there are a few things you need to consider:  Find out which schools are in your local area using the Family Services Education section. Visit the schools you are considering. They will be able to provide you with valuable information and advice, and you can ask for their prospectus. They should provide you with details of how places were allocated for at least the previous year. This does not mean that the same will happen again but it serves as a guide.  Parental Preference - It is essential to rank your preferred schools in the order you would like them to be offered. You can make three preferences and we will offer one school. Parental preference is still vitally important because, if more than one school let us know they can offer a place, we must offer the one ranked highest by you. So please think carefully about how you rank your preferences. If you have any questions regarding home to school transport. Please contact the Transport Team on 01522 782020 or use their webpage at www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/schooltransport The best way to apply for a school place is online at: www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/schooladmissions No internet access? Your local library may provide free internet access. Also schools and nurseries may be able to support you, please contact them directly to ask if they provide this service. Alternatively you can make a telephone application or contact us for a paper form by phoning 01522 782030.

        "Description": "Boston RFC is a rugby union football club in the market town of Boston, Lincolnshire. Boston RFC 1st XV Play in Midlands 3 E...ast (North). Boston rugby club also field a 2nd/Development team who play in the Lincolnshire Merit League as well as running a thriving juniors/minis section who recently won Club of the year at the Boston standard sports awards. Boston Rugby Club was founded in 1927 by Ernst Clark, a gentleman with an interest in giving his boys and their friends something to do, or rather something to keep them out of trouble. The first 'home' pitch was off Rosebery Avenue in Mountains Field, an unused plot of farmland and the players turned out in blue and white hooped shirts, as they still do. After match entertainment was at the White Hart Hotel. The hotel provided changing facilities which were an old shed out the back which included a tin tank bath. However, this did not unhinge the players as they served a fine pint of Worthington 'E'! It was like drinking dynamite - a drop so powerful that Boston people could only drink it in 1/2 pints. Visitors however drunk pints and were worse for wear very quickly. Whitbread Tankard was sold at BRFC Clubhouse In 1998 Boston Rugby Club proposed a project that would improve the development of sports within the community. The idea was to build a new facility that would house not only rugby and athletics but would also be fully accessible to people with a disability. Boston Rugby Club produced initial proposals for the enhanced facilities and these proposals were endorsed by the Borough Council in April 1998. Working in partnership with the local authority; the Rugby Club and Boston & District Athletic Club formed the 'Disabled and Able-bodied British Sports Initiative' which operated under the name of dabsi. Work soon commenced on the first phase of the project with the help of major sponsor Finnforest, a global timber manufacturer whose UK base is in Boston. The second phase of the project saw the development of the Rugby Club area and the whole development received Royal Assent when it was officially opened by the Princess Royal and is now known as the Princess Royal Sports Arena. With the new stadium the club can now offer their members the magnificent playing, training and competition facilities. The club also aims to host county and representative matches at both senior and youth level. The new bar and function area is the centre of the club and complete with a fully equipped kitchen, the clubhouse is the focus of the social side of the club. With the latest addition of two 42\" plasma televisions all international games can be viewed in style. The bar hosts everything from informal drinking to annual presentations and the club is also available for hire for birthdays, weddings and other events",

We believe that actively involving parents in their child’s early learning contributes positively towards their long‑term development. Our approach From the very beginning, we recognised the value of learning through play and the important role of parents in this process. The benefits have been acknowledged by Government and addressed in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. We continue to lead the sector in this area by delivering services which use play to promote learning and development.

Children love seeking out the funny carvings. Not just the Imp, but the cat and mouse and so many other little details that brightened the masons’ days.  In Lincoln Cathedral the architects of the gothic style perhaps reached the pinnacle of their art.  Everywhere you look there is the most intricate detail, walls, roofs elaborated by the finest carving. From above, the carving is at its best, yet not for the eye of mortal man.  From the time of the death of the saintly Bishop of Lincoln, Hugh of Avalon whose shine is shown in the picture to the right, thousands of people like you and me have come on pilgrimage to Lincoln Cathedral. It is place of pilgrimage, a place of holiness and of prayer, but also a place to explore. The Cathedral sits on the hill separated from Lincoln Castle by Castle Square from which visitors can go down Steep Hill or up Bailgate with its independent shops and restaurants.",

If you are an experienced keeper then you might like to help out with our Education Programme. If your wish to join us our membership form can be found on the “Downloads” page. Bees and man go back to the dawn of time and it is difficult to imagine how the process of pollination could happen without them. We are far more dependant on them than most people realise. Of course honey bees have been around much longer than us, some 30 million years, give or take a week or two. It is the only insect that produces food that is eaten by man. They are incredibly hard working creatures, it takes about 550 workers to gather nectar for 0.5kg of honey from 2 million flowers. Each honey bee only produces a fraction of a teaspoon of honey in its short lifespan, approx. six weeks in the summer, they literally wear themselves out foraging. They will visit 50 to 100 flowers on a single trip and communicate the location of good nectar sources to their colleagues by a series of dances.",

While the firm, diving fairways were first conceived on Earl Ancaster’s land by the legendary Harry Colt and Charles Alison, most of the credit for ‘The Heath’ goes to James Braid who put his imprint on the original design. Braid’s signature features are much in evidence - cross bunkering and grassy wastes, and very subtly undulating greens hemmed in by sculpted traps. It was mostly untouched until 2004, when the club boldly embarked on a major renovation and modernisation project under the skilful guidance of Dr Martin Hawtree. Framed by deep, swaying fescue, the holes constantly change direction and several heart in the mouth moments confront you throughout the round and the dangers ebb and flow at every turn. Added to the great golf, its serene atmosphere always makes it a delightful wander through the best of Middle England and is widely regarded as one of the finest and most challenging heathland courses in the Midlands and beyond. Visiting golfers receive a warm genuine welcome and inevitably return again and again to enjoy the seasonal challenges throughout the year.",

Experience the changing seasons from carpets of snowdrops and daffodils in spring to spectacular rhododendrons in summer and glorious leaf colour in autumn.  The Deer Park: The deer park has been home to herds of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) for around 250 years. You are welcome to walk through the public area of the deer park from January to the end of September, although we ask that you stay out of the deer sanctuary and the fishing lake area. The red deer, the largest land animals to be found wild in Britain, are easily recognisable with their reddish-brown coats. The shyer fallow deer have pale beige coats, spotted with white. In October you can hear the male deer roar and clash antlers when the dominant male tries to keep all others away from his females during the mating period. The males lose their antlers around March, so you can see the new ones developing through until August. The young are born in June and July when the mothers find a quiet spot to give birth. Throughout the summer you will see the youngsters running around the deer park. Please note that there is no public access through the deer park during October, November and December. The Woodland: The woodland contains superb mature beeches, oaks and sweet chestnuts. There are also more unusual species like the Tulip Tree and the Handkerchief Tree. Close to the Hall is a magnificent Evergreen or Holm Oak, Quercus ilex. The tree is a rarity this far north and its lower branches are worn smooth by the generations of children playing on it. You'll also find dozens of species of birds, butterflies and wild flowers in the woodland and in autumn, unusual types of fungi. A path has been installed through the woodland to make the area accessible for wheelchairs and pushchairs.",

In particular we’ve given audiences control of their experience through Silent Disco headphones. At a push of a button individuals can choose the content they want to listen to. In a culture where we use technology to automatically control the world around us, this eye opening new form of theatre has allowed our audiences to do the same thing within our shows.
